<p>Sec. 2. When any rent or advances shall become due, or the tenant about to remove from such leased or rented prem<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ises, or remove his property from such premises, it shall be lawful for the person to whom the rent or advances are pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />able, his agent, attorney, assigns, heirs, or legal representa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tives, to apply to any justice of the peace in the county where the premises are situated for a warrant to seize the property of such tenant; provided, such plaintiff, his agent or attorney, shall make oath that the amount sued for is for rent or for advances, such as are mentioned in the first section of this act, or shall produce a writing from such tenant to that effect, and shall further swear that such warrant is not sued out for the purpose of vexing and harassing the defendant; and the per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />son applying for such warrant shall execute a bond with one or more good and sufficient sureties, to be approved by the justice of the peace, payable to the defendant, conditioned that the plaintiff will pay the defendant such damages as he may sustain in case such warrant has been illegally and un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />justly sued out, which bond shall be filed among the papers of the cause, and in case the suit shall be finally decided in favor of the defendant he may bring suit against the plain<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tiff and Ins sureties on such bond, and shall recover such damages as may be awarded to him by the proper tribunal. Upon the filing of such oath and bond it shall be the duty of such justice of the peace to issue his warrant to the<pb n="59" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="57" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>proper officer, commanding him to seize the property of the defendant, or so much thereof as will satisfy the demand; which warrant shall be, if the same is within the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace, returnable to said justice; but if over the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace, the warrant shall be returnable to the district court of the county in which the leased or rented premises are situated, in which case it shall be the duty of the justice of the peace to transmit all the papers in said cause to said district court on or before the first day of the next term thereof.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. It shall be the duty of the officer to whom such warrant is directed to seize the property of such tenant, or so much thereof as shall be of value sufficient to satisfy such debt and costs, and the same in his possession safely keep, unless the same is replevied as herein provided, and make due return thereof to the court to which said warrant is returnable at the next term thereof. The defendant shall have the right at any time within ten days from the date of said levy, to replevy the property so seized, by giving bond payable to the plaintiff, with two or more good and sufficient sureties, in double the amount of the debt, or, at his election, for double the value of the property so seized; the value of the property to be as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sessed and endorsed on the warrant by the officer executing the same, conditioned that if the defendant be cast in the ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, he or some other person for him shall return to the proper officer the specific property so levied upon to satisfy the judgment that may be rendered against him, or pay off and discharge the judgment, which bond shall be approved by the officer making such levy, and filed with the papers of said cause; and should judgment be rendered against the defend<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ant and he fail to deliver the property so levied upon and replevied, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the judgment of the court, to the proper officer, within ten days after the date of such judgment, such bond shall be indorsed &#8220;forfeited&#8221; by the proper officer; and when such indorsement is made it shall be the duty of the clerk or justice of the peace, with whom the same is filed, forthwith to issue execution in favor of the plaintiff against all of the obligors in said bond, for the amount of said judgment, interest and costs; provided, in no case shall the sureties be liable for a greater amount than the amount of the bond; and provided, further, that if the property is of a perish<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />able or wasting kind, and the defendant fails to replevy<pb n="60" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="58" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>as herein provided, the officer making the levy, or the plain<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tiff or the defendant, may apply to the justice of the peace issuing the warrant for an order to sell such property; and if any person other than the defendant apply for such order of sale, the justice shall not grant such order unless the person applying shall file with such justice an obligation, payable to the defendant, with one or more good and sufficient sureties, to be approved by said justice, that they will be re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sponsible to the defendant for such damages as he may sustain in case such sale be illegally and unjustly applied for, or be illegally and unjustly made, which sale shall be conducted as sales under execution.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. It shall be the duty of the justice of the peace, at the time he issues the warrant, to issue a citation to the de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fendant, requiring him to answer before such justice, if he has jurisdiction to finally try the cause, and upon its being returned served, or in case the defendant has removed from the county without service, to proceed to judgment as in ordinary cases; and if he has not such jurisdiction, the cita<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion shall require the defendant to answer before the district court, and shall be returned with the other papers to such court; provided, that if the defendant has removed from the county, the proper officer shall state this fact in his return on the citation: and provided, further, that in case the return is made to the district court, the plaintiff shall not be obliged to file his petition before suing out said warrant, but may file the same on or before the appearance clay of the term of the court to which said papers are returnable; and further provided, that no other formalities shall be required from those mentioned in this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. Nothing in this act contained shall be so construed as to prevent landlords and tenants from entering into such stipulations or contracts in regard to rents and advances as they may think proper; and should the landlord, without any default on the part of the tenant or lessee, fail to comply in any respect with his part of the contract, he shall be responsi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ble to said tenant or lessee for whatever damage may be sus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tained thereby; and to secure such damages to such tenant or lessee, he shall have a lien on all the property in his possession not exempt from forced sale, as well as upon all rents due to said landlord under said contract.</p>
