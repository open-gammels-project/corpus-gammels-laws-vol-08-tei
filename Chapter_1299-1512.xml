<salute>An act to amend section three of an act entitled &#8220;An Act to provide for the holding of district courts when the judge thereof is absent, or is from any cause disabled or disqualified from presiding,&#8221; approved August 15, 1876.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That section three of the above recited act shall hereafter read as follows, viz: &#8220;That whenever any case or cases are called or pending, in which the district judge or the special judge chosen, as hereinbefore provided, shall be a party, or have an interest, or have been attorney, or of counsel, or otherwise disqualified from sitting in and trying the same, no change of venue shall be made necessary thereby; but the parties or their counsel shall have the right to select and agree upon an attorney of the court for the trial thereof; and if the parties or their attorneys shall fail to select or agree upon an attorney for the trial of such case, at or before the time it is called for trial, or if the trial of the case is pending and the district judge should become unable to act, or is absent and a special judge is selected who is disqualified to proceed with the trial, and the parties fail to select or agree upon a special judge who is qualified, at once, it shall be the duty of the district judge, or special judge presiding, to certify the fact to the governor immediately, by telegram, mail, or otherwise, whereupon the governor shall appoint a special judge, not so disqualified, to try the same. The evidence of such appointment by the governor may be transmitted by telegram or otherwise. The special judge so ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointed shall qualify as provided in section first of this act, and such spe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cial judge shall proceed to the trial or disposition of such case immedi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ately, if the trial is pending, otherwise when called or reached, as in other cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That an imperative public necessity requires the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring the reading of this bill on three several days, and that the rules be so suspended.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. The delay which occurs in the trial and disposition of civil and criminal cases in the courts in which the judges are or may be dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />qualified, and the parties fail to agree upon a special judge, creates an emergency for the immediate passage and taking effect of this act, and it is therefore enacted that this act shall take effect from and after its passage.</p>

In all suits for wages due by a railroad company for such labor as heretofore mentioned, upon proof being satisfactorily made that such labor had been performed, either at the instance of said company, a contractor or sub-contractor, or agent of said company, and that such wages are due, and the lien given by this act is sought to be enforced, it shall be the duty of the court having jurisdiction to try the same, to render judgment for the amount of wages found to be due, and to adjudge and order said railroad and equipments, or so much thereof as may be necessary, to be sold to satisfy said judgment.

<salute>An act to release certain inhabitants in the county of Lamar, in this State, from the payment of taxes assessed and now due for the year 1878, in consequence of a great public calamity.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Whereas, On the twenty-first day of May, A. D. 1878, there occurred a great public calamity in a portion, of Lamar county, in this state, on and near what is known as Shockey&#8217;s prairie, the same being a rain and hail storm of such destructive severity as has not been known to have, occurred within the recollection of the oldest inhabitant of this state; and</p>
<p>Whereas, The inhabitants in that portion of said county, by the rav<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ages of the said storm, lost all of their then growing crops and fences, and many of them lost their houses, stock and poultry, and all of them were so injured as to be unable to produce enough during said year to meet their necessary family expenses and pay the taxes assessed against them; and</p>
<p>Whereas, Their property had been listed for taxes before said storm, and was, by the same, so materially injured as to justify a release of said inhabitants from the payment of their taxes for the year 1878; therefore,</p>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, (two-thirds of the members of each House by a vote concurring therein), That the following named inhabitants of said portion, of said county be and they are hereby released from the payment of the several sums named, the same being the amount of state and county taxes assessed against them and now due for the year 1878, to wit:</p>

<p>Sec. 3. An imperative necessity and emergency exists which requires the immediate passage and taking effect of this act, as the tax collector is required by law to collect said several sums of taxes, by seizure and levy from said persons, if the same be not paid by the first day of March, 1879, and the several inhabitants may not, in consequence thereof, be benefitted by this act as intended; therefore, be it enacted that this act bake effect and be in force from and after its passage.</p>

<p>Sec. 2. That whenever it may become necessary, in the opinion of the district judge, to hold a special term in any county in his district, under the provisions of this act, he shall cause to be entered an order to that effect upon the minutes of a regular term of the court held in said county, and in said order shall appoint a time for the holding of such special term at a day not less than thirty days after the adjournment of the regular term at which such order is entered, which order shall state the length of time deemed necessary for the holding of such special term.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. That upon the order provided for in section two of this act being entered, the clerk of the district court of such county shall issue six notices containing a copy of the order of the court as entered, and<pb n="1343" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="43" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>also the name, style and number of each case appearing upon the docket of said court which will be before the court for disposition at such special term, which notice and copies shall be under seal of the court.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. The sheriff shall post the true copies of said notice at six public places in such county, one of which shall be at the court house door, and shall return the original notice to the special term, with his return thereon, stating the manner in which he has executed the same, which notice and return shall be entered in full in the minutes of the court.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. At any special term under the provisions of this act no grand jury shall be empanneled and no new cases can be brought to said term, but the jury commissioners at the regular term of the court at which the order for a special term is entered, shall, under the instruction of the court, select a regular venire for each week of such special term, which shall be done in accordance with the law regulating juries for any regu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lar term of the court; provided, that nothing within the provisions of this act shall be so construed as to interfere with the selecting of juries, at one regular term of the court for the next regular term of the court.</p>

<p>Sec. 68. Whenever practicable penitentiaries may be operated under a lease, in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 59. Each lease of the penitentiary shall be for some definite term, not to exceed fifteen years, after public notice by advertisement in at least three newspapers of the state, and shall be executed by the governor, upon such terms and conditions as he may deem best for the public inter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />est, special regard being had as far as practicable to the exaction of the penalty imposed by law on each convict, and to the protection, well being and humane treatment to which a convict is entitled at the hands of the state.</p>
<p>Sec. 70. No lease shall be made by which the control of the convict, except as to a reasonable amount of labor, shall pass from the state or its officers, and the management of criminals shall, in all cases and under all circumstances, remain under the control of the state and its officers.</p>

<p>Sec. 78. Upon the termination of any lease by the expiration of its term or otherwise, the lessee shall quietly and peacefully surrender and return to the state all the property belonging to the penitentiary; a like inventory and valuation shall, then be made of all the property belonging to the state, or to the possession of which it may be entitled under the terms of the lease.

<p>Sec. 82.

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That every assignment made by an insolvent debtor, or in contemplation of insolvency, for the benefit of his creditors, shall provide, except as herein otherwise provided, for a distribution of all his real and personal estate, other than that which is by law exempt from execution, among all his creditors in proportion to their respective claims, and however made or expressed, shall have the effect aforesaid, and shall be construed to pass all such estate, whether specified therein or not, and every assign<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment shall be proved or acknowledged and certified and recorded in the same manner as is provided by law in conveyances of real estate or other property.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The debtor shall annex to such assignment an inventory con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />taining the following statement:</p>
<p>1. A full and true account of all the creditors of such debtor or debtors.</p>
<p>2. The place of residence of each creditor if known to such debtor or debtors, and if not known, that fact to be so stated.</p>
<p>3. The sum owing to each creditor, and the nature of each debt or de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mand, whether arising on written security account or otherwise executed.</p>
<p>4. The true cause and consideration of such indebtedness in each case, and the place where such indebtedness arose.</p>
<p>5. A statement of any existing judgment, mortgage, collateral or other security for the payment of any such debt.</p>
<p>6. A full and true inventory of all such debtor&#8217;s estate at tire date of such assignment, both real and personal, in law or in equity, and the in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cumbrances existing thereon, and of all vouchers and securities relating thereto, and the value of such estate according to the best knowledge of such debtor or debtors.</p>
<p>7. An affidavit shall be made by such debtor or debtors, and annexed to and delivered with such inventory or schedule, that the same is in all respects just and true according to the best of such debtor or debtors&#8217;<pb n="1358" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="58" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>knowledge and belief; nothing contained in this act shall affect the assignor&#8217;s right to retain all such of his property as is by the constitution and laws of this state exempt from execution, but such list and inventory shall not be conclusive except as against the debtor making the same.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. Any debtor, desiring so to do, may make an assignment for the benefit of such of his creditors only as will consent to accept their proportional share of his estate, and discharge him from their respective claims, and in such case the benefits of the assignment shall be limited and restricted to the creditors consenting thereto; the debtor shall there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />upon be and stand discharged from all further liability to such consent<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing creditors on account of their respective claims, and when paid they shall execute and deliver to the assignee for the debtor, a release there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />from.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. Every assignee shall, within thirty days after the execution of the assignment, give public notice of his appointment in some news<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />paper printed in the county where the assignor resides, or where his principal business was conducted, or, if no newspaper be printed therein, then in the newspaper published nearest to such place of residence or business, and which notice shall be published for three successive weeks, and so far as he can, the assignee shall also give personal notice, or notice by mail, to each of the creditors of the assigning debtor.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. The creditors of the assignor consenting to such assignment, shall make known to the assignee their consent in writing, within four months after the publication of the notice provided in the preceding sec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, and no creditor not assenting shall receive or take any benefit under the assignment; provided however, that any creditor who had no actual notice of such assignment, may make known his assent at any time before any distribution of assets under the assignment has been made; and pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided further, that the receipt by a creditor of any portion of his claim from the assignee, shall be conclusive evidence of the assent of such creditor to the assignment.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. The assignee shall forthwith, after the execution and delivery of the deed of assignment, cause the same to be recorded as herein pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, and shall execute a bond with sureties, to be approved by the judge of the district or county court, conditioned that he will faithfully dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />charge his duties as such assignee, and that he will make proportional distribution of the net proceeds of said estate among the creditors en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />titled thereto, which bond shall be payable to the State of Texas, and shall be filed with the county clerk of his county, and shall inure to the benefit of the assignor and the creditor or creditors, who may maintain an action against such assignee thereon, in his or their own name, jointly or severally, for any breach thereof or violation of this law, by reason of which such assignor or creditor shall sustain damage, and upon the filing of said bond, the assignee shall take possession of the assigned property and proceed to execute the assignment.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. Every creditor, consenting to an assignment shall, within six months from the time of the first publication of the notice of the appoint<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of the assignee, file with such assignee a distinct statement of the particular nature and amount of his claim against the debtor, which shall be supported by an affidavit of the creditor, his agent or attorney, that the statement is true, that the debt is just and that there are no credits or offsets that should be allowed against the claim, except as shown by the statement, and no creditor shall take any benefit under any assign<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment whatever who neglects to file such statement.</p>
<pb n="1359" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="59" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>
<p>Sec. 8. Any creditor not consenting to the assignment may garnishee the assignee for any excess of such estate remaining in his hands, after the payment to the consenting creditors, the amount of their debts and the costs and expenses of executing the assignment.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. All property conveyed or transferred by the assignor, pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vious to and in contemplation of the assignment, with the intent or de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sign, to defeat, delay or defraud creditors, or to give preference to one creditor over another, shall pass to the assignee by the assignment, not<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />withstanding such transfer; and the assignee, or in case of his neglect or refusal, any creditor or creditors may in his name, upon securing such assignee against cost or liability, sue for, recover, collect and cause the same to be applied for the benefit of creditors as other property belong<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing to the debtor&#8217;s estate in the hands of the assignee; but if it shall appear in such action that the purchaser of any such property bought the same of the assignor in good faith and for a valuable consideration, and without any reason to believe that the debtor was conveying or trans<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ferring the same with the intent or design aforesaid, such purchaser shall be held to have acquired as against the assignee and creditors aforesaid, a good and valid title to such property.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. No assignment shall be declared fraudulent or void for want of any inventory or list as provided herein; but if such list and inventory be not annexed and verified as provided in this act, it shall be prima facie evidence that the assignor has secreted and concealed some portion of the property belonging to his estate from his assignee, unless upon the demand of the assignee or a creditor such verified inventory and list be furnished to the assignee; and if any assignee or creditor shall have rea<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />son to believe that any debtor has concealed any of his property or estate for the purpose of defrauding his creditors, it shall be the duty of the district or county judge, upon application of said assignee or creditor, to cause such debtor to appear before him, either in vacation or term time, and disclose under oath, any knowledge or information he or she may have relative to any such concealment.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. If any assignor shall secrete or conceal from his assignee any portion of the property belonging to his estate other than that which is exempt from execution, or shall, previous to and in contemplation of the assignment transfer any property with the intent or design to de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fraud his creditors, such assignor shall be adjudged guilty of a felony, and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by imprisonment and labor in the penitentiary for not less than two nor more than five years.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. The statement of a creditor, verified, and filed with the as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />signee as hereinbefore provided, shall be sufficient prima facie evidence to justify the assignee in allowing it as a valid claim against the estate, and it shall be so allowed, and such creditor entitled to his proportional share of the debtor&#8217;s estate, unless the assignor, or other creditor disput<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing the same shall, within sixty days after the expiration of the time within which the creditors are required by this act to file their state<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments, institute an action in the district or county court of the proper county to set aside the allowance and to restrain the payment thereon, for which purpose the assignor or any disputing creditor or creditors may have a remedy, jointly or severally by injunction or other proper action to try the justness and validity of the disputed claim, and if it appears that an action could not successfully be maintained at law by the creditor against the assignor upon such claim or any disputed part thereof, the<pb n="1360" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="60" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>same shall be disallowed, in whole or in part, as the case may be, and the assignee restrained from paying the same, or such portion thereof as may be disallowed; and for the information of the assignor and creditors, it is further provided, that the assignee shall allow them, or any of them, to take a copy of any creditor&#8217;s statement of his claim that has been filed with such assignee as herein provided.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. Claims that are. not due may be allowed at their present value by discounting them at the rate of interest mentioned in the con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tract, if any, otherwise at the legal rate, and if any creditor holds collat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral security of less value than his debt, the value thereof may be esti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mated by the assignee, and only the difference between such sum and the debt shall be allowed.</p>
<p>Sec. 14. If any assignee becomes unsuitable to perform the trust, re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fuses or neglects so to do, or mismanages the property, the county judge or judge of the district court may, upon the application of the assignor, or one or more of the creditors, upon reasonable notice, to all parties in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />terested, by publication or otherwise, as such judge may direct, remove such assignee and in case of vacancy by death or otherwise shall appoint another in his place, who shall have the same powers and be subject to the same liabilities as the original assignee.</p>
<p>Sec. 15. Whenever any assignee shall have in his hands funds suffi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cient to pay ten per cent. of the debts due by the assignor, he shall make a pro rata distribution of the same among said creditors, and the assignee shall be entitled to reasonable compensation for his services and his necessary costs and expenses, including also his attorneys&#8217; fees, all to be allowed, in case of difference between the parties, by the county judge or judge of the district court.</p>
<p>Sec. 16. whenever any assignee shall have fully performed the duties of his trust and desires to be finally discharged therefrom, he may make a report of his proceedings under the assignment, showing the moneys and assets that have come into his hands, and how the same have been disbursed and disposed of, the truth of which shall be verified by his affidavit, and such report shall thereupon be filed and recorded in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the assignment is re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />corded, and no action shall be brought against such assignee by reason of anything done by him under the assignment as shown by his report, un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />less the same be brought within twelve months from the time of the filing thereof, as aforesaid; and any moneys or funds on hand, shall be deposited in the district court, subject to be paid out upon the decree of said court.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That all counties, incorporated cities and towns in this state owing debts, are hereby authorized to fund the same in bonds of said counties, cities and towns, in such sums and at such rate of interest as may seem best to the authorities of said counties, cities and towns; provided, that in no case shall the rate of interest be greater than six per cent. per annum; and, provided further, that this act shall not apply to any indebtedness of any counties, cities or towns made and undertaken since the eight<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eenth day of April, 1876; provided further, that no city shall issue bonds to a greater amount than is authorized by its charter, where a limit is placed on the issue of bonds in its charter.</p>

<salute>An act to regulate the issuance and delivery of land patents, and to secure the payment of fees due thereon.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That all persons and corporations, to whom patents for land have been granted, and who have not paid the fees thereon, are hereby required to pay the same to the proper lawful officer within sixty days after the pas<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sage of this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That if, at the expiration of the sixty days from and after the passage of this act, any patents, upon which any fees may be due the<pb n="1362" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="62" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>state, remain in the office of the commissioner of the general land office, it shall be the duty of the said commissioner to add to the amount of said fees a penalty of ten per centum per month for the whole time the fees on said patents may remain unpaid, and to collect the fees and said pen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />alty from the persons or corporations to whom said patents have been granted; and said commissioner shall have no authority to deliver any person or corporation any patent for land, certified copy thereof, field notes or certificates relative thereto until the whole amount of the fees and penalty have been fully paid.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. The State of Texas has, and shall hereafter have, a lien upon all the land conveyed by or included in all patents to land granted by said state, for the amount of all fees, dues and demands due, or to become due, to the state thereon, together with all the penalties prescribed by this act, and said land shall be subject to be sold in satisfaction of said lien.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. That it is hereby made the duty of the attorney general to institute suits in the district court of Travis county, against the owners and grantees of all patents to land upon which fees may be past due six months at the institution of said suit. And it shall be his duty to sue for all fees owing thereon, together with all penalties incurred under the provisions of this act, and the laws of this state, and for all costs of suit, and for foreclosure of the lien of the state; provided, no penalties shall attach until the commissioner of the general land office shall have given notice sixty days to the person entitled to the patent, that the patent has issued, such notice to be given by depositing the same in the postoffice, postage paid, and directed to such person, when the address of the party is known to the commissioner.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. Whereas, there is now and for a long time there has been a large sum of money owing, and past due, to the State by persons and corporations to whom patents for land have been granted; and, whereas, said persons and corporations have, in many cases, wilfully failed to pay the same, therefore an emergency exists that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Sec. 2. That section nine of the above entitled act, approved August 15, 1876, be so amended as to hereafter read as follows, viz: &#8220;Section 9. If any person whose fence is insufficient under this act, shall with guns, dogs or otherwise, maim, wound or kill any cattle, or any horse, mule, jack or jennet, or procure the same to be done, such person or persons so offending shall give full satisfaction to the party injured for all damages by such person or persons sustained, to be recovered as in other suits for damages; provided, that this section shall not be so construed as to authorize any person in any event to maim, kill or wound any horse, mule, jack, jennet or cattle belonging to another.

<p>Article 4090. The governor is empowered to issue his proclamation declaring quarantine on the coast or any of the borders of Texas when<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ever in his judgment it shall be necessary, and for such length of time as he may decide to be essential to prevent the introduction of any in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fectious or contagious disease; provided, Houston, in Harris county, shall be considered a coast town within the meaning of this act.</p>

<p>Article 4090b. That he shall be of sufficient age to have acquired mature judgment, and not so old as to be inactive and incapable of active duty; and that he shall be entirely under the direction and control of the governor.</p>

<p>Article 4090d.

<p>Article 4090f. It shall then be discretionary with the governor to con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tinue or dissolve such temporary quarantine as the facts set forth may justify or as subsequent developments may indicate.</p>
<p>Article 4090f. That the laws in regard to state quarantine shall re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />main and be in full force and operation on the coast and, be enforced by the governor as heretofore, with such additional changes in stations and general management as the governor may think proper and more effective.</p>
<p>Article 4090h. That the laws in regard to local quarantine by the inhabitants of places or points shall remain in full force; provided, that in all differences and disputes between points or places contiguous or re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mote within the state, such differences and disputes shall be immediately, by the local health authorities, if any, and if none, by such authorities, county or municipal, if any there be, or if none, by the inhabitants them<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />selves, reported and submitted to the governor, and on the receipt of which he shall forthwith order the aforesaid health officer to said point or locality with instructions to investigate the same and report back to the governor the exact condition of things, and upon due investigation and deliberation the governor shall issue his proclamation declaring the determination of the issue, and by such proclamation the aforesaid dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />putes shall be governed.</p>
<p>Article 4090i. Said health and quarantine officer shall give a good and sufficient bond in the sum of ten thousand dollars, made payable to the governor, to be approved by him for the honest and impartial per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />formance of his duties, and he shall hold his position for the space of two years, subject to removal at any time that the governor may be satisfied that the public good demands.</p>
<p>Article 4090j. Whenever quarantine is declared by the governor or any county authorities or corporate authorities of this state, it, shall be the duty of such authority, within twenty-four hours of the issuance of such declaration, to establish a quarantine station or stations, where any<pb n="1388" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="88" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>person may be detained for such length of time as in the discretion of the quarantine officers is demanded by public safety.</p>

<p>Sec. 4. The near approach of the close of the session creates an im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />perative. public necessity that the rule requiring this bill to be read on three several days be suspended, and it is so suspended, and the near ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />proach of the sickly season creates an emergency which requires this bill to take effect from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

At any port where vessels shall re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceive or discharge their cargoes at an anchorage outside of the bar, such vessels shall be liable for pilotage at the above rate to such anchorage, but shall not be liable for or compelled to pay pilotage from such anchor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />age to the open sea; and if any vessel bound from the open sea to such anchorage while under way shall decline the services of a pilot, and shall afterwards receive or discharge any portion of her cargo at such anchor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />age on the lighters or otherwise, she shall be liable for the payment of half pilotage at the above rates to such anchorage to the first pilot whose services shall have been tendered to and declined by her, but not liable for any pilotage from such anchorage to the open sea; and when a pilot takes charge of a vessel twenty miles outside of the bar and brings her to it, he shall be entitled to one-fourth pilotage for such off-shore ser<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vice, in addition to what he is entitled.to recover for bringing her in; but if such off-shore service be declined, no, portion of said compensation shall be recovered.</p>

<salute>An Act to require persons enclosing public free school lands to pay an annual rent therefor.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Whereas, Many persons in this state have enclosed a large portion of the public free school lands, and have thus severed them from the public common and are using them for pasturage to the exclusion of all others, thereby giving a just cause of complaint; therefore,</p>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That each and every person who shall have enclosed by fencing or other<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />wise any of the puplic free school land belonging to the state, and shall use the same to the exclusion of the public, shall pay an annual rental value therefor of the sum of twenty-five dollars for each section so en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />closed.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. And it shall be the duty of the surveyor of each county to make a report to the county commissioner&#8217;s court on the first Monday in June in each year of the number of sections of public school lands in his county enclosed during the past year, and the names of the person or persons controlling such enclosed lands, and the number of sections con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trolled by him or them respectively.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. And the said court at the first regular term thereafter, shall make a list of the names of the persons controlling such public free school lands, the number of sections so controlled by each person and the aggregate amount due from each person, at the rate of twenty-five dollars for each section so enclosed and controlled; which list shall be recorded by the clerk of said court and a certified copy thereof forwarded by him to the comptroller of public accounts, and a like copy delivered to the collector of taxes for said county.</p>
<pb n="1402" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="102" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>
<p>Sec. 4. The collector of taxes on the receipt of such list shall proceed to collect the same under the same provisions and penalties as is imposed by law for the collection of taxes.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. That all moneys collected under the provisions of this act shall be paid by the collector into the state treasury and constitute a part of the available school fund; provided, that the state may resume control of said land at any time.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. Any person who shall control enclosed lands belonging to the public free schools and fail to pay the rental value as specified under the provisions of this act upon the demand of the collector, shall be subject to prosecution upon complaint, information or indictment, and fined in the sum of one hundred dollars for each section so enclosed.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. Whereas, this act is of demanding importance to the state; and, whereas, the near approach of the final adjournment of the present session of the Legislature creates an imperative public necessity for its passage; and, whereas, the constitutional rule requires this bill to be read on three several days, unless said rule is suspended; therefore be it enacted that said constitutional rule is hereby suspended, and it is so enacted.</p>

Should any stock not permitted to run at large enter within the enclosure of any owner or lessee of land entitled to the benefit of this act, without his or their consent, it shall be lawful for the owner or lessee of said enclosure to impound said stock; and it shall be the duty of the owner or lessee of said land to give notice immediately to the owner of said stock of their impounding and detention, and the owner of said stock shall be entitled to the possession of his or her stock on the payment of the expenses incurred in impounding and keeping said stock; provided, that in such county or subdivision said owners or lessees shall not be required to fence against stock not permitted to run at large. That three strands of barbed wire, with posts not further apart than fifteen feet, with a board not less than four inches wide and one-half inch thick hung to the top wire; or two strands of barbed wire and a board not less than five inches wide and one inch thick; or two strands of barbed wire and a rail; when boards are used, three boards, to be not less than five inches wide and one inch thick; or four rails; if made of boards or rails, the posts to be hot more than eight feet apart; when pickets are used, the pickets to be not more than six inches apart; all fencing built within the provisions of this act shall be not less than four and a half feet high, and shall be deemed a lawful fence; and, provided further, that, the in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />terval between the posts in barbed wire fences, as provided in this sec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, may be increased or diminished by order of the county commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioner&#8217;s court of any county.</p>

<p>Whereas, In some of the counties, cities and towns in this state there is an existing bonded indebtedness against the same, necessitating the collection of an overdue tax upon the people to pay the interest and pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vide a sinking fund, as required by law for the ultimate extinguishment of said indebtedness;</p>
<p>And whereas, It is believed a satisfactory adjustment, settlement and compromise of much of said indebtedness could be effected between said counties, cities and towns, and the holders of such indebtedness, if duly authorized by law, by which such indebtedness would be greatly reduced, and the taxation necessary to meet the same greatly lessened in amount;</p>
<p>And whereas, The accomplishment of this adjustment, settlement and compromise is a great public necessity, which requires the rules to be suspended that this act may become a law at the present session of the Legislature, and that it take effect and be in force from and after its passage, therefore,</p>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That the county commissioners&#8217; court of any county, or the mayor and board of aldermen of any city or town in this state, are hereby author<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ized and empowered to compromise and fund any existing bonded in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />debtedness by such county, city or town issued, and the coupons due thereon, to aid in the construction of railroads or other works of internal improvement, or other bonds issued by authority of law; and for this purpose they are hereby authorized and empowered to issue- new bonds in denomination of not less than fifty nor more than one hundred dollars, in their discretion, with interest coupons payable annually at the office of the state treasurer; said new bonds to become due and payable in twenty years, and to bear such rate of interest, not exceeding eight per cent, per annum, as in their discretion may best subserve the purpose intended by this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. No compromise shall be made under the provisions of this act, by which any debt now barred by the statute of limitation, or which may be barred at the time of such compromise shall be received, nor shall such new bonds, to be used in funding the principal of such old bonds be issued for any greater amount than three-fourths of the princi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pal of the old bonds outstanding; provided, that when the rate of interest of such new bonds is not more than five per cent, per annum, then new bonds may be issued to the full amount of the old bonds outstanding; and provided further, that the amount of new bonds to be issued for the funding of the matured interest shall be left to the discretion of the county commissioners&#8217; court or the mayor and board of aldermen as the case may be, but in no case to exceed the amount of such matured in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />terest.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. The new bonds then issued by any county shall be exempt from the payment of all county taxes, general and special, in the county by which they are issued; and the new bonds then issued by any city or town shall be exempt from the payment of all taxes levied by such city or town.</p>

<p>Sec. 4. That the county commissioners&#8217; court or mayor and board of aldermen, as the case may be, shall cause to be prepared the necessary blank bonds to give effect to the provisions of this act, the cost of which shall be paid out of the treasury of such county, city or town; said bonds, when issued by any county, shall be signed by the county judge and attested by the county clerk of such county, with the seal of the county court affixed; and when issued by any city or town, shall be signed by the mayor and attested by the recorder (or secretary if there be no recorder), with the seal of such city or town affixed; and such new bonds, whether issued by any county, city or town, shall be registered in the office of the state comptroller.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. Such new bonds may be exchanged for the old bonds at the rate specified in the second section of this act, or they may be sold and the proceeds applied to the purchase of such old bonds at the rate speci<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fied in said second section; provided, that no delivery of such new bonds shall take place unless a contract has already been entered into for the purchase of a corresponding amount of such old bonds; and, provided further, no bonds issued under this act shall be sold at less than par, each bond sold shall be made to bear the lowest rate of interest that will will give it a par value.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. That all laws now in force, providing for the collection of taxes for the payment of the principal and interest of such existing bonds, shall apply and be in force for the collection of taxes for the payment of the principal and interest of such new bonds; provided, that the sinking fund may be used in the purchase and cancellation of such new bonds whenever the same can be bought at not, more than their par value.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. The object and intention of this act being to enable the counties, cities or towns in this state which have granted subsidy bonds to railroads or other works of internal improvement, or created any bonded indebtedness whatever to compromise the same, and thereby reduce the burden of taxation, it is hereby declared as an inducement to the holders of said bonds to accept the compromise, that whenever such compromise shall be entered into and accepted in good faith, either by the holder of the present bonds or by any person purchasing said new bonds as provided in this act; that all laws now in force or which may hereafter be in force for the assessment and collection of the state taxes, shall also be in force and apply to the assessment and collection of the taxes levied to meet the interest and sinking fund of said new bonds; and in any suits which may hereafter be instituted to enforce the payment of said new bonds or coupons against any such county, city or town, no defense either in law or equity, shall be admitted in any of the courts of this state, except such as originated upon or subsequent to the issuance of such new bonds.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. Whenever a collector of taxes shall neglect or refuse to col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lect the taxes levied for the payment of the interest and sinking fund of such new bonds, he shall be liable on his official bond at the suit of any person or persons holding any of said bonds or coupons, for all such damages as said person or persons shall have sustained by reason of his neglect or refusal; nor shall such collector or his sureties be relieved of such liability by his resignation of the office, and whenever any person who may be elected collector of taxes of any county, city or town shall fail, neglect or refuse to give the bond required by law for the collection of such tax, or whenever the commissioners&#8217; court or the mayor and board of<pb n="1411" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="111" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>aldermen, as the case may be, shall appoint any person who shall tail, neglect or refuse to give said bond, or whenever they shall fail, neglect or refuse to appoint some person who will give said bond and collect said tax, then it is hereby made the duty of the governor to appoint some suitable person to collect said taxes, who shall perform all the duties required by this act or any other law of this state relating to the collec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of said taxes from the time of his said appointment until the next general election.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. No compromise which may be agreed upon between the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners&#8217; court or the mayor and board of aldermen, as the case may be, and the bondholders or others, shall be binding upon the taxpayers of any county, city or town until the terms of said compromise shall have been submitted to a vote of the property taxpayers at an election held by order of the commissioners&#8217; court, or mayor and board of aldermen, as the case may be, and a majority of the said taxpayers shall vote in favor of and ratify the terms of said compromise; said election shall be held in accordance with the general law regulating elections; provided, that none but property taxpayers shall vote at any such election; provided, further, that notice of such election shall be published for thirty days in some newspaper published in the county, city or town, as the case may be; and in case there shall be no paper published in such county, city or town, then by posting in ten public places in such county, city or town, as the case may be, for thirty days prior to any election under this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. That this act shall not, be construed to repeal an act entitled &#8220;An act to authorize counties, cities and towns to scale and fund their indebtedness, and for raising means to pay the same,&#8221; approved March 26, A.

B.) do solemnly swear that I will not directly or indirectly be interested or concerned with any contractor or contractors for the erection of the state capitol or any portion thereof, or in the proceeds or profits growing out of the same, or any work or labor done thereon, or material furnish<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ed in the erection of the same, or any portion thereof, during the term for which I am appointed, so help me God.&#8221; And any one of said offi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cers offending against the true intent and meaning of this oath shall, upon indictment and conviction, suffer all the pains and penalties of per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />jury; and in case of a violation of the conditions of the bonds provided for, shall be liable to an action thereon in the district court of Travis county, and to judgment for such damages as may be awarded against the obligors thereto by reason of the failure of the principal.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. It shall be the duty of said commissioners as soon as they shall have qualified as provided for in the foregoing section, to advertise for suitable plans for said building at a cost not to exceed five hundred dollars for advertisements and the plan and specifications which may be adopted, and said amount shall be drawn by said commissioners on their certificate deposited with the comptroller.

No sale shall be made of the lands set aside to build the capitol, except enough to defray expenses of surveying the same until such advertisement has been printed in all said papers for at least three months, and said commissioners shall with the approval of the governor contract with such responsible bidder as will construct the new capitol in a period to be determined by the governor and heads of departments for the smallest amount of said public domain so set aside, on such bidder entering into bond with the State of Texas to faithfully carry out his contract, with securities to be approved by the governor. Said bond shall be in the sum of two hun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dred and fifty thousand dollars, and shall be deposited with, the comp<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />troller.</p>

<p>Sec. 6. Should the commissioners be satisfied that any lowest bidder is not competent to the performance of his contract, or should he fail within twenty days to execute the bond hereinafter required, they may give such contract to the next lowest and best. They shall require the person or persons taking such contracts to enter into bond in double the amount of their respective bids payable to the State of Texas, with two or more good securities to be approved by said commissioners, condi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tioned for the faithful performance of the contract, and for the payment of such damages as may be sustained by reason of a failure therein, which bonds shall be deposited by said commissioners in the comptroller&#8217;s office.</p>

<p>Sec. 8. It shall be the duty of the superintendent to give his constant personal attention to the work as it progresses, and to see that each and every portion of the same is executed in the manner provided in the various contracts, and from time to time to report to said commissioners the progress of the various contracts and the manner in which they are being executed. It shall be his special duty to note every departure from any contract on the part of the contractor or any failure to perform in the manner stipulated, and give notice thereof in writing to said commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioners at his earliest convenience. He shall at all times, at the request of said commissioners give them such information touching the progress of the work, the manner of its execution, the performance of contractors and other things deemed important, as may be in his power, and shall also accompany said commissioners in their periodical visits of inspection, and give such explanation as may be required by them.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. It shall be the duty of said commissioners, on the first Mon<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />day in every month, while the work progresses, to inspect the work on said building, and to inquire into the manner in which the various con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tracts are being executed; and if they shall find any portion of the work done, or material furnished under any contract, of a character less valu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />able than stipulated for in said contract, they shall immediately give notice to the contractor that said work or material, as the case may be, will not be received; and unless such contractor immediately signifies his intention of procuring the proper material, or of reconstructing the work, as the case may be, or in case he shall so signify and shall fail to furnish such material, or perform such work within a reasonable time, said commissioners shall make known to him that his contract is at an end; and such contract shall be relet as originally provided for in this act; provided, however, if the said contractor shall have furnished any material, or done any work such as was contracted for, the said commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioners shall have the right, if in their judgment (subject to the approval of the governor), it is equitable and right, to allow the party its value, and may issue their draft on the comptroller for the amount.

<p>Sec. 11. No contract shall be let for building, which is not to be com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pleted on or before a day to be fixed by the governor, and a failure to complete in time shall work a forfeiture of the bond of the contractor, unless by reason of the failure of such contractor, or other unavoidable circumstances, the said building would be left unfinished without extend<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing a contract beyond that period.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. It shall be the duty of the commissioners to report to the governor of the state at the next regular meeting of the legislature the manner in which they have discharged their duties, the character and condition of the work done, the money expended, the various persons contracted with, the amounts and character of the contracts, the dates of the several bonds, together with the names of the obligors, the con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tracts which may have been forfeited in whole or in part, and all other information relative to the erection of said building.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. It shall be the duty of the commissioners to furnish the superintendent with a copy of the contract specified in the bond of each contractor, and they shall also give him such information from time to time as he may need or desire touching said contract.</p>
<p>Sec. 14.

<p>Sec. 15.

<p>Sec. 16. Should a contract be made to construct said new capitol for the land hereby appropriated, titles to the same shall be made to the con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tractor by the commissioner of the general land office on the certificate of the building commissioners, to be countersigned and approved by the comptroller, as the work progresses, as may be provided for in the contract.</p>
<p>Sec. 17. The new state capitol shall be erected at such place within the capitol grounds as the governor and heads of departments shall select.</p>
<p>Sec. 18. The interior and exterior walls of the new capitol shall be of the most durable building rock accessible, which shall sustain a pressure at least equal to that used in constructing the Travis county court house.</p>
<p>Sec. 19. The contract for building shall provide for fire-proof vaults sufficiently large and numerous to contain and efficiently preserve all<pb n="1415" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="115" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>the archives and papers of the different departments of the state govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment that may be located in said building, and which shall be sur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rounded and protected by masonry in the most approved manner; it shall also provide for proper pipes for supplying every department in the building with gas and water.</p>
<p>Sec. 20. Should the governor and heads of departments determine to construct a new state house on the grounds occupied by the (present capitol, they may cause all the material in the present building to be dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />posed of by sale or otherwise, as will be most economical and beneficial to the state when the contract for building the new capitol is made, and they shall make necessary arrangements for storing in other public build<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ings the state property while the house is being built, and during its con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />struction provide necessary offices for the present state officials occupying the capitol.</p>
<p>Sec. 21. The condition of the present, state capitol building creates an imperative public necessity, which justifies the suspension of the rule requiring this bill to be read on three several days, and it is so suspended and that this act shall take effect and be in force from and after its pass<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />age, and it is so enacted.</p>

Parties holding said bonds shall pay the state the difference between the market value of the securities held by them, and the bonds herein provided for, and may pay the difference in money, so as to purchase one or more bonds in cases when the bonds redeemed are not for the same amount as the bonds issued in exchange therefor.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. Should it be the desire at any time of any holder of any bonds of the denominations of not less than one hundred dollars issued under this act to have said bonds registered by the treasurer of the state, he may do so by application to the treasurer, who shall, at the wish of the holder, detach from the body of the bond each and every coupon thereto attached, and the coupons so detached shall be immediately destroyed as provided in section five of this act. The treasurer shall endorse on the face of said bond the name of the holder thereof, and on its back he shall endorse the date of registration, together with its num<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ber of registration and the amount thereon due for interest on the day of registration. The treasurer shall also enter of record in a well bound book to be kept in his office for the purpose, the number and series of said bond so registered, together with the name of the holder thereof, the date of registration and the amount of interest due on said bond, and when the bond is registered and entered of record as required by this section the holder thereof may withdraw the same, giving to the treas<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />urer a receipt therefor, and in case of a sale of said bond so registered, by the person in whose name it is entered of record, the transfer to the same shall be made by written bill of sale duly authenticated be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore some clerk of a court of record in the state where said sale is made, and the interest on said bond as it becomes due shall be paid only to the person legally owning the said bond, and in the payment of any<pb n="1424" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="124" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>installment of interest a note of the payment of the same shall be endorsed on the back of said bond.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. Whenever any county shall have any of the proceeds arising from the sale of county school lands, the same may be invested by the county at par in any of the bonds herein provided for, and when any such county shall pay into the treasury of the state any money arising from the sale of such school lands, the state treasurer shall issue and deliver to such county a bond or bonds therefor, equal, in amount to the sum or sums so paid into the treasury, and the treasurer shall endorse on said bond or bonds the name of the county purchasing and register the same in the name of the county in accordance with section eleven of this act, and after the endorsement is made the said bond or bonds shall not be transferable nor shall the principal or interest on said bond or bonds be paid except to said county as provided in this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. That the interest arising on bonds transferred to counties shall be paid out by the treasurer of the state upon presentation to him of a receipt or voucher properly signed by the county treasurer of the county holding any of such bonds, or any officer or person authorized by law to demand, receive and receipt for the same at any time after the said interest shall become due, and the treasurer shall keep a register of each bond issued to the county in a separate register kept for that pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pose and its number and amount, and the name of the county.</p>
<p>Sec. 14. It shall be the duty of the treasurer of the state to open on the books of his office an account with each county in the state which shall purchase any of said bonds, entering thereon the date of pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />chase, amount of bonds and the number of each bond, also the interest paid to each county, and date of payment, together with any other entry he shall find necessary to a true exhibit of the dealings of the several counties touching said bonds, and he shall also make to each regular session of the Legislature a full statement of said accounts.</p>
<p>Sec. 15. The holder of any warrant on the treasurer shall be entitled to receive at his option payment at not less than current value, and in no case at less than one hundred cents on the dollar in bonds of the denomi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nation of five and ten dollars issued under this act, and the amount of the warrants so satisfied with bonds, except the amounts of such warrants as are or may be drawn on the deficiency appropriation to the aggregate of two hundred thousand dollars, shall be reserved from the general revenue and used in retiring the outstanding bonded indebtedness of the state in accordance with this act; provided, that not more than fifty thousand dol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lars of said bonds per month shall be paid out on warrants under this section.</p>
<p>Sec. 16. The bonds created by and issued under this act shall be received by the comptroller and treasurer in lieu of money in payment of the principal arising from any sale of lands belonging to the public free schools, university or asylums, and said bonds when received shall be placed to the credit of said special funds.</p>
<p>Sec. 17. That the sum of five thousand dollars, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby appropriated out of any money in the treas<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ury not otherwise appropriated to pay the expense of engraving and printing the bonds provided for by this act, for publishing notices, paying traveling expenses, and carrying out the provisions of this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 18. The fact that a portion of said bonds should be sold on or before the first day of July, 1879, creates an emergency that requires this act to take effect at once, and it is therefore declared that this act<pb n="1425" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="125" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That title fifty-eight of the Revised Civil Statutes of this state, passed February 21, 1879, be amended by adding articles 3122a and 3122b, viz:</p>
<p>&#8220;Article 3128a. That all persons leasing or renting any residence or store-house or other building shall have a preference lien upon all the property of the tenant in said residence or store-house or other building for the payment of the rents due and that may become due, and such lien shall continue and be in force so long as the tenant shall occupy the rented premises and for one month thereafter, but this article shall not be considered as in any manner repealing or affecting any act exempting property from forced sale.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereas, It is credibly reported that in several counties in the west<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ern and southwestern part of the state, the people are being depredated on in person and property by bands of criminal and lawless men too strong to be suppressed by the civil authorities unaided, and by bandits and robbers from Mexico; therefore, for the purpose of maintaining law and order and giving security to that section against foreign invasion and domestic disturbance and to aid the civil authorities,</p>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That the governor is hereby authorized to immediately organize a com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pany of twenty-five men rank and file to wit: Twenty-one privates, two sergeants and two corporals, and in addition thereto there shall be one captain and one first lieutenant and in the aggregate said company shall consist of twenty-seven men, officers and non-commissioned officers and privates.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That said company shall be mustered into the service of the State of Texas for the period of twelve calendar months, or longer or shorter, and may be disbanded when they are no longer needed, should the governor deem it necessary, in such manner as the adjutant general may direct. Each officer, non-commissioned and private thereof, shall furnish his own horse, saddle, bridle, rope, clothing, etc., for the entire term of service, and replace any or all of said articles, should it become necessary so to do.</p>

<p>Sec. 3. That the State of Texas shall furnish said company with arms, ammunition, camp and garrison equipage, and rations of subsistence for the men and forage for the horses, and with transportation necessary to move said supplies. The arms shall be issued and charged to the men, and in case any of said arms shall be lost through neglect or by disobe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dience of orders, the value thereof shall be charged upon the rolls as a stoppage against the party losing the same; but in no case shall arms lost in the discharge of duty be so charged.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. The members of said company shall be allowed the following pay, to wit: The captain, one hundred and twenty-five dollars per month; the first lieutenant, one hundred dollars per month; the ser<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />geants, corporals and privates, thirty dollars each per month.

<p>Sec. 5.

<p>Sec. 6. That the officers, non-commissioned officers and privates of said company shall be clothed with the powers of peace officers, and shall aid the civil authorities in the execution of the laws. They shall have authority to make arrests, and in such cases they shall be governed by the laws regulating and defining the powers and duties of sheriffs when in the discharge of similar duties. They shall, before entering upon the dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />charge of these duties, take an oath before some authority legally author<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ized to administer the same, that each of them will faithfully perform his duties in accordance with law.

<p>Sec. 7. When said company or any member or members thereof shall arrest any person charged with the commission of a criminal offense or offenses, they shall convey such person or persons to the county or coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties where he or they stand charged with the commission of an offense, and shall deliver him or them to the proper officer, taking his receipt therefor, and all necessary expenses thus incurred shall be paid by the stale.</p>

<salute>An act in relation to chattel mortgages and other instruments intended to operate as mortgages of, or liens upon personal property and the record thereof.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That every chattel mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument of writing intended to operate as a mortgage of, or lien upon, personal property, which shall not be accompanied by an immediate delivery, and be fol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lowed by an actual and continued change of possession of the property mortgaged or pledged by such instrument, shall be absolutely void as against the creditors of the mortgagor or person making the same, and as against subsequent purchasers and mortgagees or lienholders in good faith, unless such instrument or a true copy thereof shall be forthwith deposited with, and filed in, the office of the county clerk of the county where the property shall then be situated, or if the mortgagor or person making the same be a resident of this state, then of the county of which he shall at the time be a resident.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Upon the receipt of any such instrument the clerk shall en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dorse on the back thereof the time of receiving it, and shall file the same in his office, to be kept there for the inspection of all persons interested; provided, that if a copy be presented to the clerk for filing, instead of the original instrument, he shall carefully compare such copy with the original, and the same shall not be so filed unless it is a true copy thereof; and a copy can be filed only when the original has been acknowledged.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. A copy of any such original instrument, or of any copy thereof, so filed as aforesaid, certified to by the cleric in whose office the same shall have been filed, shall be received in evidence of the fact that such instrument or copy was received and filed according to the endorse<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of the clerk thereon, but of no other fact.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. The comity clerk shall keep a book in which shall be entered a minute of all such instruments, which shall be ruled off into separate cob umns, with heads as follows: Time of reception, name of mortgagor, name of mortgagee or trustee and cestui que trust, date of the instru<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment, amount secured, when due, property mortgaged, and remarks; and the proper entry shall be made under each of such heads. Under the head of property mortgaged it will be sufficient to enter a general des<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cription of the property pledged and the particular place where located, and index shall be kept in the manner as required for other records.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. When the debt secured by any such instrument shall have been fully paid or satisfied, it shall be the duty of the mortgagee, his as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />signee or personal representatives to enter or cause to be entered satisfac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion thereof; such entry of satisfaction shall be made in the book in which the instrument is entered, which may be done under the head of &#8220;remarks,&#8221; and any instrument acknowledging satisfaction, need not be recorded at length, but it shall be sufficient for the mortgagee or clerk to make an appropriate entry under the head of &#8220;remarks,&#8221; showing that the same has been paid; and if there is a separate instrument acknowl<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />edging satisfaction it may be filed with the original instrument or copy thereof, and preserved therewith in the office of the county clerk.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. The person making any such instrument shall not remove the property pledged from the county nor otherwise sell or dispose of the same without the consent of the mortgagee; and in case of any violation<pb n="1435" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="135" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>of the provision of this section the mortgagee shall be entitled to the possession of the property, and to have the same then sold for the pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of his debt, whether the same has become due or not.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. Chattel mortgages and other instruments intended to operate as mortgages of, or liens upon, personal property, shall not hereafter be recorded at length as heretofore required, and when deposited and filed in accordance with the provisions of this act shall have the force and effect heretofore given to a full registration thereof, and all persons shall be thereby charged with notice thereof and of the rights of the mort<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gagee, his assignee or representative thereunder, but nothing herein con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tained shall be so construed as to in any manner affect the rights of any person under any instrument recorded as required by law.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. The county clerk shall be entitled to the sum of twenty-five cents for filing and making the entry as aforesaid, when any such instru<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment is deposited in his office, and twenty-five cents for entering satis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />faction thereof as herein required.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. All laws and parts of laws inconsistent with the provisions of this act are hereby repealed.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. Whereas the end of the session is near, and the season of the year is at hand when a great many persons execute mortgages upon grow<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing crops and other personal property to procure supplies for their fam<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ilies and hands, therefore an emergency exists, and an imperative public necessity demands, that the constitutional rule which requires a bill to be read on three several days be suspended and this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage.</p>

<p>Sec. 4. The board after the notice given, mentioned in section three of this act, shall proceed to pass upon all claims submitted to them under the requirements of this act, except such claims as have been heretofore audited under an act of the Fifteenth Legislature, entitled &#8220;An act to ascertain the amount due teachers for services rendered in the public schools, from September 1, 1873, to January 1, 1876, and to provide for the payment of same,&#8221; and the board shall mark upon each claim sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mitted, in words and figures, the amount due thereon.</p>

<p>Sec. 7. Having ascertained the amounts due from each district, the board shall furnish the commissioners&#8217; court with a correct list of the several amounts due each claimant, together with a description, as far as practicable, of the bounds of each district.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. It shall be the duty of the commissioners&#8217; court, upon the receipt of said list, to make the necessary levy on the property of each district separately that is in arrears, to raise sufficient revenue to satisfy said claims of teachers, including such balances on claims as were audited under the act of the Fifteenth Legislature referred to in section four of this act, and to satisfy which, sufficient levy has not already been made under said act; provided, that any one who may hold receipts for payment of a part or whole of his indebtedness, under a previous act, shall have credit therefor.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. It shall be the duty of the county treasurer to report to the commissioners&#8217; court the amount obtained from each district, as soon as full returns have been received from any given district.</p>
<p>Sec. 10.

In the event the records of the late board of school directors show that there are no claims outstanding and due teachers as herein specified, or that sufficient tax has already been levied under any law heretofore existing to pay off such claims, but not yet collected, it shall not be necessary to reorganize said board, but the late county superin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tendent of public instruction shall certify such facts in writing to the commissioners&#8217; court.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. The members of the auditorial board shall be allowed each four dollars per day for every day they shall be engaged in the discharge of their duty as such board, including the time in going to and returning from the county seat, and all other officers mentioned in this act;<pb n="1437" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="137" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>and the collector of taxes shall receive such compensation as is now allowed by law for similar services.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That whenever it shall appear to the satisfaction of the county court of any county in this state, or notice shall be given such court by the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioner of the general land office, that the boundary or any part there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />of of the county is not sufficiently definite and well defined, such court shall appoint an experienced and competent practical surveyor, whose duty it shall be to ascertain, by actual survey, the boundary or any part thereof, of said county, and to make and establish the lines and comers in the manner herein prescribed; and the said court in the order making the appointment shall specify the line or lines to be run, and the comers to be established and marked; and shall in all things conform to the law defining the boundaries of said county.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The initial corners of the surveys herein provided for shall be designated by posts, mounds or stone monuments; the posts shall be of hewn cedar, cypress or bois d&#8217;arc at least eight inches in diameter, five feet long and set in the ground not less than three feet; the mounds shall be of stone when practicable, otherwise of earth and not less than two feet high; that at the end of each mile in said boundary a like post, mound or stone monument shall be established; the initial corners shall be described on the post or monument established there.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. In the field notes of the surveys of the lines ordered to be run, the surveyor shall give an accurate description of all prominent natural objects crossed by or adjacent to said lines, as well as of the corners and lines of surveys on or near said boundaries.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. That it shall be the duty of the court making such order to cause a copy thereof to be sent to the comity courts of the counties inter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ested in such boundary, stating the time and place, which time shall not be later than twenty days after the meeting of the county court of the county notified, for the commencement of the survey, and such notice shall be given at least ten days before the meeting of said county court; and it shall be the duty of the court so notified to appoint an experienced and competent practical surveyor to proceed at the time and place to assist in running and establishing such line.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. That the surveyors herein provided for, shall take the oath of office prescribed by law for county surveyors, and shall, before entering upon the duties herein prescribed, enter into bond with two or more se<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />curities, to be approved by the county court, in the sum of one thousand<pb n="1438" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="138" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>dollars, payable to the county judge or his successors in office, condi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tioned for the faithful uerformance of his duties.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. When the line shall have been surveyed and marked as herein provided, it shall be the duty of the surveyor to make due return of the field notes and map to the county court; which field notes and map shall be recorded by the clerk, and a certified copy thereof returned to the gen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral land office.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. That if either of the surveyors appointed to run and mark such line, shall fail to attend at the time and place appointed, the one in attendance shall proceed alone to perform the duties assigned him, and make his report to the county court of the county employing him which, being approved by such court, shall be recorded as evidence of the line in question, and the line so surveyed and marked shall thereafter be regarded as the true boundary line between the counties.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. That should the surveyors above provided for fail to agree as to the true boundary line between their respective counties, the facts of such disagreement, with a full statement of the questions at issue between them, shall be by them reported to the commissioner of the general land office, whose duty it shall be to examine the disputed matter at once, and from such data as the maps and archives of his office furnish, shall desig<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nate to such surveyors the line to be run, stating at what specific point they shall begin and to what specific point they shall run, adhering as nearly as possible to the line designated in the act creating such county line, which instruction shall be authority for said surveyors to run such line, and the line so run as above directed shall thereafter be the true dividing line between said counties.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. The expense of surveying and marking such line shall be divided between the counties interested in proportion to the frontage of each county upon the line, and paid for by each county as proportioned. The surveyors appointed as herein provided shall receive for their ser<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vices the sum of three dollars per mile for each mile run. The expense of establishing the posts, mounds or stone monuments shall be paid by the counties interested, and they shall be erected under the supervision and direction of the surveyor.</p>

<p>Sec. 11.

<p>Whereas, The present financial condition of the state and the heavy burden of taxation resting upon the people, imperatively demands of this Legislature the inauguration of all reforms in the interest of econ<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />omy which do not impair the efficacy of government; and</p>
<p>Whereas, The large amount now being paid for conveying convicts to the penitentiary suggests the great importance of devising some less ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pensive but equally safe means of transporting convicts; therefore,</p>
<p>Section 1.

<p>Sec. 2. That the operation of all laws concerning the transportation of convicts be and the same are hereby declared to be suspended during the existence of any such contract as mat provided for in the preceding section, and the governor shall, by proclamation, give notice for the mak<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing of such contract, and a copy of such proclamation shall be forwarded by the secretary of state to each sheriff in the state; and each sheriff shall, after issuance of said proclamation upon demand, deliver to the order of the party contracting with the state all convicts, together with a copy of the-decree of the court before which said defendant or defend<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ants were tried, convicted and sentenced, taking and filing among the pa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pers in his office a receipt therefor.

<p>Sec. 3. In all cases where a convict is demanded by a contractor, or by any agent appointed by him, the authority of such person under the seal of state presented to the clerk of the court in which the con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />viction has been obtained shall be a sufficient authority for the said clerk to issue his warrant in the name of the state, requiring said contractor or his agent to take charge of said convict and deliver him inside the walls of the penitentiary, or to the lessees.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. The interests of the State of Texas involved in this bill are such as creates an emergency that this bill should take effect from and after its passage, and the near approach of the session&#8217;s close is such an imperative necessity as justifies the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring this bill to be read on three several days, and the said rule is hereby suspended.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. The heavy expense of carrying convicts to the penitentiary under the existing law creates an imperative public necessity that this act take effect immediately, and it is therefore enacted that the same lake effect from and after its passage.</p>

<p>Sec. 6. That assessments of lands rendered to the comptroller under the provisions of this act, shall be made by the party rendering the same under oath, as to their value; but if the comptroller think the valuation too low he shall object, and if the comptroller and the party rendering the land cannot agree, then the comptroller shall assess the same at such value as he, as a sworn officer, may think it is worth; and if the party rendering feels that the assessment is too high, he may appeal to the board of equalization, which, for such purposes, shall consist of the gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernor, attorney general and the secretary of state, and their decision shall be final.</p>

<p>Sec. 9. Should there be no purchaser of said lands, then the comp<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />troller shall bid the same in to the state for the taxes due thereon and the costs of sale, and make a deed to the state to the same, including in one deed all lands bid in for the state or any one else.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. Should the lands bid in by the comptroller for the state not be redeemed by the owner thereof or his agent within two years, by the party redeeming the same paying double the amount for which the said land was sold, then the said lands thus sold and unredeemed shall become vacant and revert to and become a part of the public free school fund, to be sold and disposed of as other lands belonging to the public free school fund are to be sold and disposed of by law.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. The comptroller shall give to the purchaser of any lands the sale of which is provided for in this act a deed to the same, giving in such deed such description of the land as may be necessary to identify the same, or such description as he may be in possession of.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. The comptroller shall keep a list of the purchaser or pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />chasers of all such lands in his office, showing the name and postoffice of the purchaser or purchasers, together with the amount and description of the land sold, and the amount for which it was sold, and the date of sale.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. The deed given to the purchaser or purchasers by the comp<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />troller under the provisions of this act shall vest a good and sufficient fee simple title in the purchaser or purchasers, subject to be impeached only for actual fraud; provided, the former owner or owners thereof do not redeem the same within two years from the date of deed, either by paying to the purchaser or purchasers double the amount for which said land was sold, or by making a tender of the same to him or his agent, or by depositing with the comptroller before the expiration of two years double the amount for which such land was sold, to be paid by the comp<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />troller, when called upon, to the purchaser [or purchasers] thereof.</p>
<p>Sec. 14. All county taxes collected under the provisions of section 1 of this act shall be paid into the county treasury of the organized county to which such unorganized county is attached for judicial purposes.</p>
<p>Sec. 15. All county taxes due unorganized counties collected by the comptroller shall be kept by him to the credit of such unorganized county until the same shall have been organized, then he shall, upon the de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mand of the treasurer of the former unorganized county, pay the same over to said treasurer.</p>
<p>Sec. 16. All money received by the comptroller on deposit for the redemption of lands sold and bought by individuals, shall be by him de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />posited in the state treasury as a special deposit, subject to the order of the party to whom the conditional deed to such land was given.

<p>Sec. 17. Whereas there is no law now in this state providing for the collection of taxes due from unorganized counties, and whereas the financial condition of the state and the just equalization of the burdens of taxation demand the immediate passage of such a law, therefore an imperative public necessity exists requiring the suspension of the con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stitutional rule requiring this bill to be read on three several days; there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore resolved, that said rule be suspended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage.</p>

<p>Section 1.

<p>Sec. 2. The comptroller shall forward to the county commissioners&#8217; court of the counties, as soon as practicable, the lists described in the foregoing section, for the purpose of compiling therefrom accurate lists of the unrendered lands in their respective counties, from 1871 to 1876, with the aid of the tax assessor of the county and the county surveyor; and the county commissioners&#8217; court shall fix a reasonable compensation for the surveyor and assessor.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. Upon receipt of the lists herein described, the county judge shall give notice by posting, in six public places in the county that lists of assessments on lands in the county, from 1871 to 1876, have been filed for correction and revision, and for all parties interested to examine the lists for deter [m]ining whether their respective renditions and assess<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments have been properly entered.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. It shall be the duty of the commissioners&#8217; court, at regular or called sessions, to hear the application of parties at interest, to correct the records so as to credit grants with assessments which they may claim to have made on grants; and to generally do all their discretion may<pb n="1462" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="162" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>suggest to credit the grants with assessments of parties; and to rectify imperfect descriptions of parties who may have rendered lands, but whose assessments are not identified, so as to be able to compile a list of the unrendered lands, with the aid of the county assessor and surveyor, so as no parties at interest who may have rendered lands in good faith, will be embarrassed by their erroneous descriptions, said court being empow<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ered to adjust any and all claims by parties who may have rendered their lands, or paid their taxes, so as their interests will not be disturbed.

<p>Sec. 5. At the expiration of one year from the date of receipt of the records in the county from the office of the comptroller, it shall be the duty of the commissioners&#8217; court, county surveyor and county assessor to make a complete compilation of the credits allowed on each and every grant in the county; showing the original grants in alphabetical order, and the names of the parties entitled to credits of renditions on the grants respectively, and the number of acres belonging to the credit of each party; the compilation shall also show the balance of acres on each grant for each of the years separately on which it appears that taxes are due, and the value of such unrendered lands.

<p>Sec. 8. Upon the receipt of the unrendered rolls by the collector of taxes of a county, he shall immediately advertise by notice in six public places in the county that he has said rolls in his hands for collection of the taxes, and that at the expiration of three months from the date of the notice, he will on the first Tuesday following proceed to sell at public outcry the several tracts or parcels on which taxes appear due, for the taxes of each and every year for which they may appear as due.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. At the time designated in the notice of the collector of taxes he will proceed to sell at public outcry all lands on which taxes appear as due on the rolls of unrendered lands under the same rules as are pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />scribed by general law for sales of lands for current taxes; and in making said sales he shall be governed by instructions from the comptroller of public accounts as to the manner of aggregating taxes of several years when taxes are due for more than one year on a grant, and for making re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />turns of sale and settlement therefor.</p>

<p>Sec. 13. Where the owner of land sold to an individual purchaser for taxes makes affidavit and files the same with the comptroller of public accounts, that he has used diligence to find the purchaser of the same for the purpose of redemption, and that said purchaser cannot be found, or is a non-resident of the county in which the land is situated, or is a non<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />resident of the state, such owner may deposit the amount necessary to redeem the land in the state treasury to the credit of the purchaser, and the comptroller shall thereupon issue a certificate of redemption to said purchaser canceling the deed to said purchaser; which certificate shall be admissible of record in the county in which the land is situated when signed and sealed by the comptroller with the seal of his office, said pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment and deposit to be made within two years from the date of the sale.</p>

<p>Sec. 15. Where it appears that a tract or parcel of land has been assessed from and inclusive of the year 1873 to and inclusive of 1876, the commissioners&#8217; court shall make no account of taxes against said tract for years prior to 1873, but the back taxes and penalties of every descrip<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion will be held as satisfied and extinguished, and any sale to the state, made prior to 1871, of said tract, will be canceled and held for naught.</p>
<p>Sec. 16. In making up the rolls of balances of unrendered property, the commissioners&#8217; courts are fully empowered and authorized, in cases where there is only a small portion of a grant appearing as unrendered for any year from 1871 to 1876, to strike out said balance and make no account of taxes against said unrendered portion of such grant; said court, in its discretion, being empowered to judge of the individual case and to determine as to whether the interests of the state or county will be prejudiced by striking out unrendered balance.</p>
<p>Sec. 17. In making up the unrendered list of lands, no taxes will be held as due on tracts or parts of tracts until the year next succeeding the year in which the patent was issued, as shown by the printed copy of abstract of titles and patented lands issued from the general land office.</p>

<p>Sec. 19. The fact that large sums in the shape of taxes on unrendered lands are being lost to the state every year, and the near approach of the close of the present session of the Legislature making it impracticable that this bill shall be read on three several days, therefore an imperative public necessity and emergency exist, authorizing the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days; and it is therefore enacted that this act be in force and take effect from and after its passage.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That article 4761 of the Revised Civil Statutes be amended so as to read as follows:</p>
<p>Article 4761. The collector of taxes whenever he may receive as much as five hundred dollars ($500) or more belonging to the state, shall pay the same over to the state treasurer in such manner as may be directed by the comptroller of public accounts or by law, reserving only his com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mission on the same and to enable him to do so, he may at his own risk, secure and send the same in postoffice orders or solvent drafts on solvent banks, at not more than the usual rates of exchange, to be paid by the state; and it shall be the duty of the comptroller to enforce a strict ob<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />servance of this act; and the collector of taxes shall finally settle with the comptroller and pay into the treasury all funds in his hands arising<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />from taxes assessed for the previous year and all occupation taxes col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lected to date, on or before the first day of July of each year; provided, that whenever the collector shall be authorized to pay any warrant, he<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />shall be permitted to pay the same over to the treasurer as money.</p>
<p>Sec. 2.

<p>Article 3748. Such petition shall set forth: First&#8212;that the appliea<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="1472" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="172" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>tion is made in behalf of a white or colored community, as the case may be.

<p>Article 3150. Such communities may be organized for male and female schools, separate or mixed, as the population and necessities and conditions of each community may require; provided, that in towns of not more than fifteen hundred inhabitants, no more than two school com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />munities for white children and two communities for colored children shall be organized.</p>
<p>Article 3752. Three trustees shall be appointed by the county judge for each community school, and the three citizens named in the petition shall in all cases be appointed trustees, unless the county judge be satis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fied from personal knowledge that the parties so named are either un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />worthy or incompetent. Said trustees shall discharge such duties as are herein prescribed, or which may be prescribed by the board of educa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, and shall see that the schools for which they are trustees are con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ducted in accordance with the provisions and limitations of this law. Said trustees shall be removed from office by the county judge upon the written application of a majority of the patrons of the school.</p>
<p>Article 3753. It shall be the duty of the trustees of a school com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />munity, already provided with a school house, to contract with a teacher holding a certificate of competency from the county judge to teach school for the community for as long a period as the school fund entered to the credit of the community will warrant. The school shall open at such times, as the trustees may decide, and be taught continuously until the close of the term, unless suspended by the trustees. The trustees shall, in some public way, give two weeks notice of the time of opening the school.</p>
<p>Article 3754. The contract entered into between the trustees and<pb n="1473" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="173" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>teacher shall be written and shall specify: 1. The grade of certificate held by the teacher. 2. The salary or compensation to be paid per month. 3. The length of school term. 4. The average per cent. of daily attendance agreed upon as necessary to warrant the continuance of the school; provided, no such contract shall authorize or permit any part of a school house belonging to the state for the benefit of free schools to be used as a residence, but shall prohibit the same.</p>
<p>Article 3755. After the receipt from the board of education of a cer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tificate showing the amount of state school fund due the county for the next succeeding scholastic year, the county judge shall, on the second day of August of each year, apportion the fund called for in the certifi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cate of credit to the organized school communities in his county, and to such children of scholastic age residing in his county, but duly reported as listed in communities in adjoining counties. The apportionment shall be made upon the basis of the number of state pupils represented by the revised community list on file in the county judge&#8217;s office, together with the number of like pupils, residents of the county, duly reported as reg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />istered in adjoining counties. In no event shall the apportionment to any community exceed the sum necessary for the support of the school as required by law for a longer period than ten months, estimating twenty school days to the month. The apportionment being made, the county judge shall direct the county treasurer to credit each community according to the name and number thereof, with the aggregate pro rata of the school fund ascertained to be due, and he shall give notice to the trustees of the respective communities of the sum entered to their credit.</p>
<p>Article 3757. Pupils not of scholastic age may attend the community school upon payment of such tuition fees as may be agreed upon between the teacher and parents of such children, but trustees shall not enter into any contract or permit any contract to be made whereby the interest of state pupils may be subordinated to the interest of private pupils.</p>
<p>Article 3758. Trustees shall make their contract with the teacher on the basis of the number of children of scholastic age registered in the community, but no teacher shall be entitled to full pay unless the average daily attendance of such pupils amount to at least seventy-five per cent. of the whole number registered on the community list; and if the: aver<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />age daily attendance be less than seventy-five per cent., but as much as fifty per cent., the teacher shall be entitled to seventy-five per cent. of the compensation set forth in the contract. If the average daily at<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tendance should be less than fifty per cent. of all the pupils of scholastic age registered in the community, then the teacher shall only be paid for actual daily attendance, or the trustees, may at their discretion cause the school to be discontinued. In lieu of a contract based on the num<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ber of state pupils registered in the community, the trustees may, at their discretion, contract for actual daily attendance only.</p>
<p>Article 3759. Trustees, in making contracts with teachers, shall deter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mine the salary to be allowed or wages to be paid upon the following rates of tuition: To teachers holding a first-class certificate, not more than two dollars; to those holding a second-class certificate, not more than one dollar and fifty cents; and to such as hold a third-class certificate, not more than one dollar per month per capita shall be allowed for pupils within scholastic age. And it shall not be lawful for trustees or teachers to demand as a condition of admittance into school the payment of extra tuition for pupils of scholastic age; provided, that in no event shall the teacher holding a first-class certificate receive from the public free school<pb n="1474" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="174" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>fund more than sixty dollars per month; and those holding second-class certificates, more than forty dollars per month; and those holding third<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />class certificates, more than twenty-five dollars per month.</p>
<p>Article 3760. Trustees may employ one or more assistant teachers whenever the average daily attendance exceeds thirty-five pupils. If the necessity for employment of an assistant teacher is caused by the attend<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ance of private pupils, then the trustees shall require the teacher to em<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ploy, at his or her expense, an assistant holding a certificate of compe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tency as a teacher.</p>
<p>Article 3763. When the nearest school community for children within scholastic age residing near a county line is situated in an adjoining county such children may be registered in said community, and the county treasurer of the county in which such children reside shall pay for the tuition of the same out of the fund entered to their credit, upon presentation of a voucher therefor, approved by the county judge of the county in which said children reside.</p>
<p>Article 3766. Any one desiring to teach a public free school shall, un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />less known to the county judge, present a certificate from the justice of the peace of the precinct in which he or she desires to teach, or in which he or she may reside, or in case the applicant has acquired no residence in this state, then some other certificate satisfactory to the county judge, that the applicant is of good moral character and of correct exemplary habits; the county judge shall thereupon, unless satisfied that some good cause exists for refusing such certificate, convene the county school board of examiners, and direct an examination of the applicant on the branches hereinafter named, as follows, to wit: Applicants for third-grade certifi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cates shall be examined in orthography, reading, writing, arithmetic and geography. Applicants for second-grade certificates shall be examined in the branches named in the third grade, and also in English grammar, composition and history of the United States. Applicants for a first<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />grade certificate shall be examined in the branches named in the third and second grades, and also in the elementary branches of algebra, geom<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />etry and natural philosophy, school discipline and methods of teaching. The examination must be conducted in the English language, and no applicant shall receive, a certificate unless the board of examiners be sat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />isfied that he or she is competent to teach the branches named in the grade of certificate applied for, in the English language.</p>
<p>Article 3767. The board of examiners shall examine such applicant as to his or her competency to teach the branches named in the preced<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing section, and shall make a report of such examination to the county judge, who shall, if such report be favorable, issue a certificate of com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />petency (attaching the county seal thereto) to the applicant according to the grade recommended by the board of examiners, authorizing his or her employment by the trustees of any school community in the county in which the same is issued.</p>
<p>Article 3770. It shall be the duty of teachers to keep an accurate record of the daily attendance of each pupil, and all other statistical data required by the state board of education, and shall make a full report thereof to the county judge at the close of their respective schools.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The following articles: 3739, 3741 and 3764, and all laws and parts of laws in conflict with the provisions of this chapter as amended are hereby repealed.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. In view of the fact that the present session of the Legislature<pb n="1475" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="175" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>will in a few days adjourn sine die, and it being important that this chapter of the Revised Civil Codes of the State of Texas should be amended, an imperative public necessity exists for the suspension of the rule requiring bills to be read on three several days, and it is therefore enacted that said rule be suspended.</p>

If it shall appear that such person is the owner of property of the value of five hundred dollars, or that the value of the property sold or conveyed together with the value of the property still owned by such person, amounts in the aggregate to the sum of five hundred dollars, then such person shall not be entitled to the certificate herein provided for, which proof shall be supported by the evidence of two credible witnesses of the identity of such person, and that his or her statements are worthy of belief, and that they believe them to be true; all of which proof shall be reduced to writing and signed by said parties, and certified to by the county judge, under the seal of his office, attested by the clerk, and which shall be furnished the commissioner before the issuance and deliv<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ery of the certificate; provided, that should said commissioner have any grounds to believe, or be advised that the applicant is physically able to support himself, or that he is not truly in indigent circumstances, as de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fined in this act, or that the applicant was fraudulently or illegally en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rolled as an indigent pensioner, under the act approved July 28, 1816, then he shall suspend the issuance of the land certificate herein provided for and require further proof, in the manner and to the extent he may designate.</p>

Said board shall appoint a principal teacher and such assistant teacher or teachers of said school and other officers as may be necessary for said school, and shall make such by-laws, rules and regulations for its government as they may deem proper, and shall regulate the course of study and the manner of performing labor and the kind of labor to be performed by the students, and shall provide for the board, lodging and instruction of the students without pecuniary charge to said students, and shall regu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />late the course of discipline necessary to enforce the faithful discharge of the duties of all officers, teachers, students and employes of said school, and shall have the same printed and circulated for the benefit of the peo<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ple of the state, of the officers and students of said school.</p>

<salute>Joint Resolution on yellow fever.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Whereas, Great interest has been manifested by the president of the United States and congress on the subject of yellow fever and its pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vention, and to test the question of yellow fever in the United States by a system of non-intercourse during certain months with countries in which it undoubtedly originates, and as the joint committee of congress will soon close its labors and report to congress without probably having obtained sufficient data thereon, therefore,</p>
<p>Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That the prompt action taken by congress in appointing a joint committee, together with scientific experts, to investigate the history of yellow fever, with the view to prevent its recurrence in any portion of our country, is highly com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mendable.</p>
<p>Resolved, That as the subject is one that concerns the lives, happiness and welfare of the people, it is the opinion of the Legislature of Texas that the natural history of yellow fever should be studied by scientific experts in its original habitats, and it respectfully recommends that con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gress send such experts to the West Indies, Mexico and Brazil to elicit all the conditions under which it originates, to the end that yellow fever may be excluded from our country, and that commerce may be restricted only so far as may be compatible with public health.</p>
<p>Resolved, That the governor shall furnish copies of these resolutions to the senators and representatives of Texas, to lay before congress and the joint committee on yellow fever, and that these resolutions take effect from their passage.</p>
<p>Resolved, That an imperative public necessity requires that the con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stitutional rule that this resolution be read three several days in each house should be suspended, and it is therefore suspended.</p>

<p>Whereas, Aransas Pass has, for time immemorial, had ten (10) feet of water on its bar, thus affording easy and indispensable communication for commerce to the city of Corpus Christi and the broad extent of country lying between the Nueces and Rio Grande, dependent on this pass for its business relations; and</p>
<p>Whereas, By unusual currents the water on the Arandas Pass bar has been reduced to four and a half (4&#189;) feet in depth within two years or<pb n="1486" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="186" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>thereabouts, to the most serious injury of the city and large territory above named, practically excluding them from all commerce by water transportation; therefore,</p>
<p>Be it resolved, That our senators in congress be instructed and our representatives be requested to urge upon congress the imperative neces<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sity of making an appropriation for deepening, as soon as practicable the water on the said Aransas Pass bar in conformity with the recom<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mendation already made by the United States survey, for the purpose of restoring on the pass its former usual depth of water, which is of indes<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pensable need for the commerce of the cities of Corpus Christi, Rock<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />port, Fulton and all the adjacent country between San Antonio river and the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>As the present session of congress will terminate by law on the fourth of next month, (March), in order that this resolution may reach congress in time for their action, an imperative necessity exists that it be adopted and go into effect immediately.</p>

<p>Whereas, by the act of March 6, 1875, further payments to the state on account of said purchasers were deferred until the title to said lands should be settled, and it is to the interest of the state, as well as her duty to the said vendees, to have said titles adjudicated and finally cleared and determined; therefore,</p>

<p>Whereas, By the joint resolution of the congress of the United States, approved December 29, 1845, admitting Texas into the union as one of the states thereof, it was declared that the State of Texas was &#8220;admitted into the union on an equal footing with the original states in all respects whatever;&#8221; and,</p>
<p>Whereas, section four, article four of the constitution of the United States provides, among other things, that the United States shall protect each of the states against invasion; and,</p>
<p>Whereas, the United States has failed, to make good this guarantee to the State of Texas, in consequence of which failure the State of Texas has incurred large and heavy expenses to the amount of one million seven hundred and eighty-seven thousand six hundred and forty dollars and forty-two cents ($1,787,640 42) in keeping state troops on the frontier to defend the border counties and the citizens thereof against the invasions and depredations of predatory bands of hostile Indians and Mexicans; and,</p>
<p>Whereas, by an act of congress, approved January 21, 1860, there was appropriated one hundred and twenty-three thousand five hundred and forty-four dollars and fifty-one cents ($123,544 51) to cover expenditures by the State of Texas for frontier defense between January 28, 1855, and January 28, 1861, which has never been paid to or drawn by the State of Texas; and,</p>

Each amendment proposed shall be voted upon separately, and the proc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lamation shall prescribe the words to be written or printed upon the tickets: &#8220;For or against each amendment.&#8221; Immediately after the elec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion the officers of each precinct shall forward to the county judge of their county a duplicate return showing the number of votes cast for or Against the amendment; and on the tenth day thereafter the county judge shall open and count said returns, and forthwith forward to the secretary of state in a sealed package a tabulated statement thereof, showing the total number of votes cast in the county for or against the amendment, and on the fortieth day after said election the secretary of state shall, in<pb n="1496" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="196" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>the presence of the governor and attorney general, open and count said returns, and if it shall appear from the returns that a majority of the votes were cast for said amendment, it shall be the duty of the governor, on the following day, to issue his proclamation setting forth the fact that, said amendments have received a majority of the votes cast at, said elec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, and shall proclaim that said amendments have become and are a part of the state constitution.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The fact that amendments to the constitution have been sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mitted by this Legislature to a vote of the people, and the late hour of the session, creates an imperative necessity that the rule requiring this<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />resolution [to] be read on three several days be suspended, and it is so ordered, and an emergency requiring that this resolution go into effect at once, and it is therefore enacted that this resolution take effect and be in force from and after its passage.</p>
