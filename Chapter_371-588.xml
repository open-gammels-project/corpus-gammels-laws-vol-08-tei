<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas. That all that portion of land in the State of Texas heretofore set apart and appropriated for the use of the several tribes of Indians residing within the limits of<pb n="377" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="5" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>the State, as recited in above preamble, be and the same is hereby declared abandoned by the United States Government and reverted back to this State</p>

<p>Sec. 2. That it shall require the vote of two-thirds of the qualified voters of the county to remove the county seat of such county; provided, however, that if the county seat shall have been established at a point at a greater distance than five miles from the geographical centre of such county, the distance to be ascertained and established by calculation made and certified to by the Commissioner of the General Land Office of the State, upon the map of the county, filed in the General Land Office, or a copy thereof, a majority only of the legal votes cast at such election, shall be necessary to remove it to a point, less than five miles distant from the geographical centre of such county; and that the said dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tance of five miles shall be measured from the ascertained and established geographical centre of such county to the centre of the ground on which the court house building is sit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />uated or proposed to be erected; provided, further, that when a county seat has been located within five miles of the centre of a county, and a portion of the county has since such loca<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, been attached to another county, leaving it seven miles distant from the centre, not less than two-thirds of the quali<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fied voters of the county shall remove it.</p>

<p>Sec. 4. Any legal voter of the county may contest the re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sult of said election, by filing within twenty days after the result of said election for said county seat has been declared, his written protest against said result as declared, with the clerk of the county court, which protest shall contain the grounds on which said voter intends to contest said election.

<p>Whereas, It appears that the lives and property of the citi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />zens of Texas are exposed to great danger, and there has been great loss of the same, by reason of the forays of armed bands from the Republic of Mexico.</p>
<p>Whereas, It is the duty and obligation of the United States to protect said citizens, and to guard well our Rio Grande border from foreign invasions.</p>
