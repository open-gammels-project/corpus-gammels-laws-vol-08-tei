<p>Sec. 4. The laws regulating practice and proceedings in the Supreme Court, and regulating appeals and writs of error thereto, shall apply to the Court of Appeals, but when the District Court from which an ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />peal has been or may be taken, is by the Constitution deprived of juris<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />diction over the subject matter in controversy, in such case the mandate issuing from the Court of Appeals, on the disposition of a cause trans<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ferred to it under the third section of this act, shall be directed to the<pb n="840" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="4" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>highest court of the county from which the appeal was taken, having original jurisdiction over the subject matter in controversy; and in such case the Clerk of the court to which the mandate is directed, shall demand and receive from the Clerk of the court from which the appeal was taken, the original papers in said cause, and the court to which the mandate is directed shall then exercise jurisdiction over the case.</p>

<p>Sec. 4.

<salute>An Act to provide for refunding money paid into the State Treasury in certain cases.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Whereas, Under the provisions of an act to provide for the sale of the alternate sections of land, as surveyed by railroad companies and set apart for the benefit of the common school fund, approved April 24th, 1874, many citizens of the State of Texas have settled upon lands which they erroneously supposed to be portions of said alternate sections of land set apart for common school purposes; and, whereas, said citizens have by reason of said error paid into the State Treasury a part of the pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />chase money for said lands, when in truth, and in fact, said lands so paid on by them were not a part of the lands set apart for said common school fund; and, whereas, there exists no legal remedy for these parties who have so paid, as aforesaid, and they having received no considera<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion for said payments so made; therefore,</p>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That any person or persons who may have heretofore purchased any land of the State supposed to have been set apart for the benefit of the school fund, and who cannot obtain a patent or title to the same, because the land designated by said purchaser, and for which the settler has paid the money into the Treasury, was not a part of the school fund of the State, shall have the right to recover the money so paid in the following man<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ner : Said party, or his heirs or assigns, shall present to the Comptroller of Public Accounts the certificate given him by the County Surveyor in pursuance of the requirements of Section 7, of &#8220;An Act to provide for the sale of the alternate sections of land surveyed by railroad com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />panies, and set apart for the benefit of the common school fund/&#8217; ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />proved April 24th, 1874, and a certificate from the Commissioner of the General Land Office, stating that the land designated in said surveyor&#8217;s certificate is not and was not at the time of the purchase a part of the said school fund; and also the receipt of the Treasurer showing the amount paid on said lands, and satisfactory evidence of the identity of the party in whose favor the claim is made; whereupon the Comptroller shall issue his warrant upon the State Treasury for the amount of money paid in by the purchaser.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That since a majority of the persons above named are poor and unable to do without the use of their money thus erroneously paid into the State Treasury, there exists a sufficient emergency that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That the second section of the above recited act, approved May 8, 1873, and entitled, &#8220;An Act regulating contested elections,&#8221; shall be amended so as to read as follows, to-wit:</p>
<p>&#8220;Section 2. If the contest be for the validity of an election for any district or county office, a copy of the notices and any other papers served on the parties shall be filed with the Clerk of the District Court of the county in which the residence of the party holding the certificate of elec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion is; and when so filed, the entry of the trial of said contest shall be made upon the docket of said court, the same as in other causes, and said contest shall be tried at the next term of said court, and under the rules governing proceedings in other causes, except that the questions of fact which may be at issue between the contesting parties shall be passed upon by the court without the intervention of a jury; and if on trial any vote or votes be found to be illegal or fraudulent, the court shall subtract such vote or votes from the poll of the candidate for whom cast, and after a full and fair investigation of the evidence shall decide to whom the office belongs; or should it appear that the election was illegally or fraudu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lently conducted; or that by the action or want of action on the part of the officers to whom were entrusted the control of such elections, such a number of legal voters were denied the privilege of voting as, had they been allowed to vote, might have materially changed the result; or if it appear that such irregularities existed as to render the true result impos<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sible to be arrived at, or very doubtful of ascertaining, to order a new elec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion as the facts and necessities may require; and the costs of the suit shall be taxed according to the laws governing costs in other causes; and such causes shall have the precedence over all other causes, both in the District Court and upon appeal in the Supreme Court; provided, that if more than sixty days will have elapsed from the return day after such election, before the first day of any regular term of the District Court in which any contested elec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion is pending, then, and in that event, it shall be the duty of the Judge of said District Court to hear the cause in the chambers at as early a day, to be fixed by him, as may be practicable, and he shall direct the District Clerk to give to the contesting parties at least ten days&#8217; notice of the time of hearing such cause. And it shall be the duty of the officer in whose charge the custody of the several boxes containing the polls, tally lists and poll lists may be, at any time, upon application by either of the contesting parties in such causes, and<pb n="907" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="71" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>the filing of an affidavit, that both of the duplicate poll lists or tally lists required by law, were sealed up in any of such boxes, to open the same, after having given at least five days&#8217; notice to the opposite party, of the application, and of the time and place when and where he will open said box or boxes; and to take therefrom one of the poll or tally lists, and to hold the same, subject to the examination of either of the said contesting parties; after which he shall immediately close up the said box or boxes, and securely seal the same. Or should either of the said contesting parties file his application with an affidavit of his inability to otherwise procure for examination any duplicate poll or tally list used at such elec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, to open the box containing the other duplicate, and to take the same therefrom and hold it subject to the examination of said contesting parties, and to immediately thereafter seal up the said box securely; pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, that the notice to the opposite party, above provided for, shall in all such cases be given.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Whenever notice of contest and the answer thereto shall have been filed in the office of the District Clerk, it shall be the duty of the contestee to file with the said District Clerk a bond, with two or more good and sufficient securities, to be approved by the said Clerk, in an amount to be determined by said Clerk, but not less than double the probable amount of fees to be realized from the office during the term being contested for, said bond to be conditioned, in the event of the decision of the contest herein provided for, against him and in favor of the contestant, that he will pay over the said contestant whatever sum may be adjudged against him by a court having jurisdiction of the sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ject matter of said bond. And if any such contestee shall fail or refuse to file such bond before the time fixed by law for entering upon the dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />charge of the duties of the office in dispute, then, and in that event, it shall be the duty of the said District Clerk to notify the said contestant of the said failure or refusal, who shall thereafter have ten days in which to file a like bond, conditioned, in the event of the determination of the said contest against him, and in favor of the said contestee, to pay over to the said contestee whatever sum may be adjudged against him by a court having jurisdiction of the subject matter of said bond. Immediately upon the filing of said bond, it shall be the further duty of said District Clerk to certify the failure or refusal of the contestee to file the said bond, to the Governor, and the filing of said bond by the contestant; whereupon it shall be the duty of the Governor to issue a commission to the said contestant for the time pending said contest; provided, that it shall be the duty of the Governor to issue the commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sion to the said contestee at the time regularly provided for by the gen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral election laws of the State, unless he has in the meantime been no<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tified of his said failure to file the said bond hereinbefore provided for, in which event he shall withhold the issuance of such commission until after the time herein allowed the contestant to file his said bond has elapsed; but if the said contestant shall fail to file his bond within the time herein provided for, it shall be the duty of the said District Clerk to certify all the facts in the case to the Governor, who shall proceed to issue the said commission to the said contestee; provided further, that if any person, at the date of the passage of this act, shall have already have entered upon the discharge of the duties of any office, his right to which is being contested in any District Court in this State, he shall be required to file the bond hereinbefore provided for, within twenty days from the said passage of this act, and in the event of his failure or<pb n="908" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="72" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>refusal to do so, it shall be the duty of the clerk of said court to give no<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tice of such failure or refusal to the contestant, who shall thereafter be al<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lowed ten days in which to file his bond, as hereinbefore provided for; and if he shall file said bond within the time above specified, it shall then be the duty of the said Clerk to certify all the facts in the case to the Gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernor, who thereupon shall annul the commission heretofore issued to the said contestant (contestee), who shall enter upon and discharge the duties of the office in dispute, pending the said contest. But if the said contestant shall fail or refuse to file his said bond, as herein provided for, then, and in that event, the said contestee shall remain in possession of said office, and shall continue to discharge its duties, pending the said contest.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. That all the provisions of this act shall apply to election con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tests, now pending, as well as to those hereafter to be commenced.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. That all acts or parts of acts, now in force, in conflict with any of the provisions of this act, be, and the same are hereby repealed.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. That whereas, in a large number of the counties of this State, under the constitutional ordinance fixing the times for holding the Dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trict Courts of this State, no regular terms of said Courts can be held for many months; and whereas, in many of said District Courts there are election contests now pending in regard to various offices in the State; and whereas, the public interests are being made to suffer by reason of said contests, and the uncertainty thereby engendered as to who are prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erly entitled to said offices; and whereas, under the said constitutional or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dinance the determination of these said election contests must otherwise be necessarily greatly delayed; therefore, an emergency exists which makes it very necessary for the public welfare that this act shall go into immediate operation; therefore, be it further enacted by the Legislature of Texas that this act shall go into effect and be in full force from and after its passage.</p>

<p>Sec. 21. The Clerk shall write the names of all the jurors entered of record on separate slips of paper, as near the same size and appearance as may be, and when a jury is wanted for the trial of any case, the same shall be drawn from a box, after the slips of paper above mentioned shall have been deposited therein, and well mixed. The Clerk shall pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vide and keep for that purpose a suitable box with a sliding lid.</p>

But before either party shall be required to strike, those on the list shall be challenged for cause, and others drawn and placed as drawn upon the list, in place of as many as may be set aside for cause. In all cases when the jury shall be com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pleted, the names of all jurors constituting a panel, not on the jury, shall be returned to the box, from which another jury may be drawn; and when from any cause it may be necessary to make up a jury, if there be not enough of the standing jurors remaining, or in attendance, the court shall order for the occasion a sufficient number of other jurors, possessing all the qualifications prescribed for jurors in this act, to be summoned by the Sheriff, to make up the deficiency in said jury; pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, that in summoning said jurors to supply said deficiencies, it shall not be lawful for the Sheriff or any officer to summon as a juror any person found in the court-house, or court yard, if they can be had else<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />where.</p>
<p>Sec. 23. Whenever a special venire shall be ordered, the names of all the persons selected by the Jury Commissioners to do jury service for the term at which such venire is required, shall be placed upon tickets of<pb n="919" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="83" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>similar size and color of paper, and the tickets be placed in a box which shall be well shaken up; and from this box the Clerk, in the presence of the Judge in open court, shall draw the number of names required for said special venire, and the names of the persons so drawn shall be at<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tached to the writ of special venire facias, and the persons named shall be summoned by the Sheriff, or other lawful officer, by virtue thereof; provided, that when the whole number of jurors selected by the Jury Commissioners for any term of the court shall be less than the number required upon said special venire, the Judge shall order the Sheriff to summon a sufficient number of good and intelligent citizens, having all the qualifications of jurors prescribed in this act to supply the defi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ciency; provided, that in supplying the deficiency, it shall not be lawful for the Sheriff or any other officer to summon as a juror any person found within the court-house or yard, if they can be had elsewhere.</p>
<p>Sec. 24. The court may adjourn the whole or any part of the jury to any day of the term, but jurors shall not be paid for the time they stand adjourned.</p>
<p>Sec. 25. If the challenge to the array shall be sustained, the court shall order the whole panel to be discharged, and a new one to be sum<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />moned from the qualified jurors of the county; or a special jury may be summoned to try the cause of the party challenging.</p>

<p>Sec. 27. Six men shall compose a jury in the courts of Justices of the Peace, and in all inferior courts of this State; and all jurors in such courts shall possess all the qualifications, and may be challenged for the same causes prescribed in this act; and in jury trials in such courts each party shall be entitled to three peremptory challenges.</p>
<p>Sec. 28. That at each term of the District Court, the Jury Commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioners appointed at that term shall, at the same time and place at which they shall select petit jurors for the next term, also select from the citizens of the different portions of the county, sixteen persons, to be summoned as grand jurors for the next term of the District Court,<pb n="920" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="84" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>from whom the grand, jury shall be formed, taking those who attend and are not excused by the court, as their names appear upon the list; and the deficiency, if any, shall be supplied under the direction of the court. The persons so selected as grand jurors shall possess all the qualifications required by law for grand jurors, and shall also possess all the qualifications prescribed in this act for petit jurors, and persons summoned to supply any deficiency, shall possess the same qualifica<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions. The names of the persons selected as grand jurors by the Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners shall be written upon a piece of paper, and the fact that they were so selected shall be certified to and signed by the Jury Commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioners, who shall place said piece of paper so signed in an envelope, and seal the same and endorse thereon the words: &#8220;The list of grand jurors selected at &#8212; term of the District Court,&#8221; (the blank to be. filled by the proper designation of the court). The Commissioners shall write their names across the seal of said envelope and direct the same to the District Judge, and deliver it to him in open court, and the same proceedings shall be had by the Judge, Clerk and Sheriff, or other officer, as are prescribed in this act with reference to the list of petit jurors.</p>
<p>Sec. 29. That all laws and parts of laws in conflict with the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visions of this act be and the same are hereby repealed.</p>

The jurisdiction of said court shall be exercised as provided in this act, and wills shall be admitted to probate, and letters testamentary or of administration shall be granted: first, in the county where the deceased resided, if he had a domicil or fixed place of residence in the State; second, if the deceased had no domicil or fixed place of residence in the State, but died in the State, then either in the county where his principal property was at the<pb n="930" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="94" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>time of his deaths or in the county where he died; third, if he had no domicil or fixed place of residence in the State, and died without the limits of the State, then in any county in this State where his nearest kin may reside; fourth, but if he had no kindred in the State, then in the county where his principal estate may be situated.

<p>Sec. 12. Whenever any person named as executor shall have been absent from the State when the testator died or when the will was proved, whereby he was prevented from presenting the will for probate within thirty days after the death of the testator, or from accepting and qualifying as executor within twenty days after the probate of the will, or whenever he shall have been prevented by sickness from so present<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing the will or so accepting and qualifying, he shall be allowed to ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cept and qualify as executor at any time within sixty days after his re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />turn to the State, or his recovery from sickness, upon making proof to the court that he was so absent or prevented by sickness; and if in the meantime letters of administration with the will annexed have been granted, such letters shall be revoked; provided, he shall have first caused the person to whom letters have been granted to be cited to appear be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore said court and show cause why said letters should not be revoked.</p>

<p>Sec. 15. Whenever letters of administration shall have been granted upon an estate, and it shall afterwards be discovered that the deceased left a lawful will, such will may be proved in the manner provided in this act; and if an executor is named in such will he shall be allowed to ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cept and qualify in the manner herein provided; but if no such executor be named, or if the executor named be disqualified, or shall renounce the executorship, or shall neglect to accept and qualify within twenty days after the probate of the will, or shall neglect for a period of thirty days after the discovery of such will to present it for probate, then administra<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, with the will annexed, of the estate of such testator shall be granted according to the provisions of this act; and whenever such executor shall accept and qualify, or whenever any person shall be appointed and qualified as administrator with the will annexed, the letters of adminis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tration previously granted shall be revoked; but all acts done by the first administrator, previous to the qualification of the executor or ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ministrator with the will annexed, shall be as valid as if no such will had been discovered.</p>

<p>Sec. 18. Whenever an estate is unrepresented by reason of the death, removal or resignation of the executor or executors, or administrator or administrators, the court shall grant administration with the will an<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nexed of the estate not administered, or administration of the estate not administered, as the case may be, in the same manner and under the reg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ulations herein prescribed for the appointment of original administrators.</p>
<p>Sec. 19. Whenever an executor or administrator has been qualified in the manner required by this act, the certificate of the Clerk of the court, attested by the seal of said court, as to the qualification of said executor or administrator, shall be sufficient evidence of such appoint<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment and qualification when it shall be necessary to make proof of such fact.</p>
<p>Sec. 20. Wills shall be probated, and letters testamentary or of ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="934" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="98" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>-ministration with full powers shall be granted, only in open court at a regular term thereof, after application in writing and notice as herein<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />before required; but whenever it may appear to the County Judge that the interest of an estate requires the immediate appointment of an ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ministrator, he shall either in open court or in vacation, by writing un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />der his hand and seal of the court, attested by the Clerk, appoint some proper person administrator pro tem., with such limited powers as the circumstances of the case may require. Such appointment may be made without notice, shall define the powers conferred, and before being de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />livered to the person appointed shall be recorded in the minutes of the court, and the Clerk shall endorse thereon a certificate that it has been so recorded; and until such record and certificate are made, the appoint<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment shall not take effect; such appointment shall cease to be of force on the first day of the term of the court next after the date thereof, unless continued in force by an order entered upon the minutes in open court; and in no case shall such appointment continue in force beyond the first day of the second term of the court next after the date thereof.</p>
<p>Sec. 21. Pending any contest relative to the probate of a will, or the granting of letters of administration, whether such contests be in the County Court or in any other court on appeal, it shall be the duty of the County Judge to appoint an administrator pro tem., in the manner pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />scribed in the preceding section, and with such limited powers as the circumstances of the ease may require; such appointment may continue in force until the termination of the contest and the appointment of an executor or administrator with full powers.</p>
<p>Sec. 22. Before the issuance of letters of administration pro. tem. under the provisions of the two preceding sections, the person appointed shall take and subscribe an oath and enter into bond; which bond and oath shall be in substance the same as the bond and oath required of other administrators, varying the form to suit the particular case; and such bond and oath shall be filed and recorded in the like manner as other bonds of administrators.</p>
<p>Sec. 23. If there be more than one executor or administrator named in the letters, any one or more of them, on the neglect of the rest, may return an inventory as required by this act; and the executor or adminis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trator so neglecting shall not thereafter interfere with the estate, or have any power over the same; but the executor and administrator so returning shall have thereafter the whole administration, unless within two months after the return, the delinquent or delinquents shall assign to the court some reasonable excuse which it shall deem satisfactory.</p>
<p>Sec. 24. When an administrator of the estate not administered has been, or shall be hereafter appointed, he shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the former executor or administrator, except such rights and powers conferred on the former executor by the will of the testator as are different from those conferred by this act on executors generally; and such administrators shall have power to make themselves parties to all suits prosecuted by the former executor or administrator of the estate, and may be made parties to all suits prosecuted against the former executor or administrator of the estate. They shall have power to settle with the former executor or administrator of the estate, and to receive and receipt for all such portion of the estate as remains in their hands; they shall have power to bring suit on the bond or bonds of the former executor or administrator in their own name as ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ministrators for all the estate that has not been accounted for by such<pb n="935" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="99" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>former executor or administrator; and they shall proceed to administer such estate in like manner as if their administration was a continuation of the administration of the former executor or administrator, with the exceptions hereinbefore named; but such administrators shall, within one month after being qualified, return an inventory and list of claims in like manner as is required in this act for original administrators; and they shall also, in like manner, return additional inventories and lists of claims. And whenever an executor shall accept and qualify, after letters of administration shall have been granted, such executor shall, in like manner, succeed to the previous administrator; and he shall proceed to administer the estate in like manner as if his administration was a continuation of the former one, subject, however, to any legal di<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rections of the testator in relation to the management of the estate.</p>
<p>Sec. 25. Whenever, under the provisions of this act, an administrator pro tem. shall have been appointed, and an executor shall afterwards he qualified, or an administrator appointed, such executor or administrator shall succeed and be made a party to all suits and actions prosecuted by or against such administrator pro tem.; and such executor or administra<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tor shall have the right to settle with such administrator pro tem., and receive and receipt for all the estate remaining in his hands, and shall have the right to sue, in like manner as is provided for in the previous section, on the bond of such administrator pro tem., for all the estate not accounted for by him.</p>
<p>Sec. 26. Executors and administrators shall be removed by the County Judge without notice, in term time, by an order entered on the minutes of the court in the following cases: First, when they neglect to qualify in the manner required by this act within twenty days after the will is probated, or the order is made for granting of their letters. Second, when they shall neglect to return to the court, within sixty days after re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceiving their letters, an inventory of the estate committed to their charge, so far as the same has come to their knowledge. Third, when they have been required to give a new bond, and neglect to do so within the time prescribed by the court. Fourth, when administrators absent themselves from the State for a period of three months, without the permission of the court.</p>
<p>Sec. 27. Executors and administrators may be removed by the County Judge, of his own motion or on the complaint of any person interested in the estate, after being cited to answer such complaint or motion, in the following cases: First, when they shall fail to make to the court any exhibit that they are required to make by the provisions of this act, or when they shall fail to comply with any order that the County Judge is authorized to make against them, under the provisions of the same. Second, when there shall appear sufficient grounds to believe that they have or are about to misapply, embezzle or remove from the State, the property committed to their charge. Third, when they are proved to have been guilty of gross neglect or mismanagement in the performance of any of their duties. Fourth, when they fail to obey any order of the court consistent with this act, in relation to the estate com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mitted to their charge. In the cases enumerated in this section, on proof being made that the executor or administrator has removed from the State or otherwise endeavored to elude the service of process on any such complaint or motion, the same may be heard and determined, though the citation be not served; and in all cases where an executor<pb n="936" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="100" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>or administrator is removed, the causes of such removal shall be set forth in the order of removal.</p>
<p>Sec. 28. If any person named as executor shall have renounced the executorship, or shall have been removed therefrom, he shall not after<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />wards be appointed administrator of the estate; and whenever any per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />son shall have been removed from the administration of an estate, he shall not afterwards be appointed administrator thereof.</p>
<p>Sec. 29. If at any time an executor or administrator shall wish to resign the administration of the estate that has been committed to his charge, he may present to the court from which his letters issued, a full and complete exhibit of the condition of the estate, together with his administration account&#8212;both of which shall be verified by affidavit&#8212; and also his application in writing for leave to resign; whereupon it shall be the duty of the clerk to make out a citation returnable to some reg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ular term of the court, which citation shall state the presentation of such exhibit, account and application, the term of the court to which it is returnable, and shall require all those interested in the estate to ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pear and contest such account if they see proper. Such citation shall be published for at least twenty days in some newspaper printed in the county, if there be one; if not, then by posting copies thereof for a like period at three public places in the county. Proof of such publication may be made by the affidavit of the publisher or printer attached to a copy thereof. At the return term of such citation, or at some other term to which it may have been continued, upon the County Judge being sat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />isfied that such citation has been published or posted, as the case may be, he shall proceed to examine such exhibit and account, and to hear all proof that may be offered in support of the same, and all objections and exceptions thereto; and shall, if necessary, re-state such accounts, and shall audit and settle the same. If it shall then appear that such execu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tor or administrator has accounted for all said estate according to law the County Judge shall order him to deliver the estate, if there be any remaining in his possession, to some person who has given bond for the same, in like manner as herein prescribed for administrators. Upon complying with such order, said executor or administrator shall be per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mitted to resign his trust and be discharged.</p>
<p>Sec. 30. Before the issuance of letters testamentary or of administra<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion with the will annexed, the person named executor or appointed administrator with the will annexed, shall, before the Clerk or County Judge, or any officer authorized to administer oaths, take and subscribe an oath in form as follows: &#8220;I do solemnly swear that the writing which has been offered for probate is the last will of -----, so far as I know or believe, and that I will well and truly perform all the duties of executor of said will, or of administrator with the will annexed, of the estate of said -----."</p>
<p>Sec. 31. Before the issuance of letters of administration, the person appointed administrator shall, before the Clerk or County Judge, or any officer authorized to administer oaths, take and subscribe an oath in form as follows: &#8220;I do solemnly swear that -----, deceased, died without leaving any lawful will, so far as I know or believe; and that I will well and truly perform all the duties of administrator of the estate of said -----."</p>
<p>Sec. 32. Before the issuance of letters testamentary or of adminis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tration, the person named as executor or appointed administrator, shall enter into bond with at least two good and sufficient sureties, to<pb n="937" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="101" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>be approved by and payable to the County Judge of the county, in such penalty as he may direct, not less than double the estimated value of the estate of the testator or intestate; provided, however, that when any tes<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tator shall direct in his will that no security shall be required of the person, or persons named therein as executor or executors, letters testamentary shall be issued to such person or persons without any bond being re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired.</p>
<p>Sec. 33. The oath of an executor or administrator may be taken and subscribed, or his bond may be given, either in term time or vacation, at any time before the expiration of twenty days from the probate of the will or the order granting the letters, or before his letters shall have been revoked for failure to do so within the time allowed, and all such oaths and bonds shall be filed and recorded by the clerk.</p>
<p>Sec. 34. The following form may be used for the bonds of executors and administrators:</p>
<p>The State of Texas, county of -----. Know all men by these pres<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ents, that we, A. B., as principal, and C. D. and E.

A. B. C. D. E. F.</p>
<p>Sec. 35. Whenever a married woman may be appointed as executrix, and shall wish to accept and qualify as such, she may jointly with her husband execute such bond as the law requires, and acknowledge the same before the County Judge or Clerk of the court, or any Notary Public of the county where the will was proved or letters were granted; and such bond shall bind her estate in the same manner as if she were a feme sole; and whenever an executrix may be a married woman she shall act as a feme sole in all matters pertaining to her said representative ca<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pacity; provided, that no married woman shall administer the estate of her former husband during the continuance of the second or subsequent marriage.</p>
<p>Sec. 36. Whenever a surviving husband or wife under twenty-one years of age shall wish to accept and qualify as executor or executrix, or administrator or administratrix, he or she may execute such bonds as the law requires, and acknowledge the same before the County Judge, Clerk of the Court, or any Notary Public of the county in which the will was proved or letters of administration were granted, and such bonds shall be as valid as if he or she were of lawful age.</p>
<p>Sec. 37. When the sureties upon an executor&#8217;s or administrator&#8217;s bond, or any one of them, shall die, or shall remove beyond the limits<pb n="938" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="102" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>of the State, or shall become insolvent; or when in the opinion of the County Judge the sureties upon any such bond are insufficient, it shall be his duty, either in term time or vacation, to cause a citation to be issued and served upon such executor or administrator, requiring him to appear and show cause why he should not be required to give a new bond, on a day named in such citation, which may be in term time or vacation. And on the return of said citation served, the County Judge shall inquire into the truth of the matter, and if satisfied of the truth thereof, he shall require such executor or administrator to give a new bond.</p>
<p>Sec. 38. Any person interested in an estate may present a petition to the County Judge, representing that the bond of the executor or ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ministrator is insufficient, whereupon it shall be the duty of the County Judge, either in term time or vacation, to cause a citation to be issued and served on such executor or administrator, requiring him to appear upon a day named in the citation, which may be either in term time or vacation, and show cause why he should not be required to give a new bond; and on the return of such citation served, the County Judge shall inquire into the truth of the fact alleged, and if satisfied of the in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sufficiency of the bond he shall require such executor or administrator to give a new bond; provided, that the administrator or executor shall pay all the costs of this proceeding when the bond is sufficient, and said administrator or executor shall not pay out any money or do any other official act after said service upon him until his new bond is ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />proved.</p>
<p>Sec. 39. The sureties upon the bond of an executor or administrator, or any one of them, may at any time present a petition to the County Judge, praying that such executor or administrator may be required to give a new bond, and that he or they may be discharged from all liability for the future acts of such executor or administrator; whereupon it shall be the duty of said County Judge, whether in term time or in va<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cation, to cause a citation to be issued and served on such executor or administrator, requiring him to appear, on a day named in the citation, which may be either in term time or in vacation, and give a new bond; and whenever such new bond shall have been given and approved by the County Judge, such sureties shall be discharged from all liability under their bond for the future acts of such executor or administrator.</p>
<p>Sec. 40. In all cases where a new bond shall be required from an ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ecutor or administrator, under the provisions of this act, an order to that effect shall be entered in the minutes of the court, naming the time within which new bond shall be given; and until such new bond shall have been given and approved, the order shall have the effect to suspend the powers of such executor or administrator.</p>
<p>Sec. 41. The bond of an executor or administrator of any kind shall not become void on the first recovery, but may be put in suit and pros<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ecuted from time to time until the whole amount thereof shall have been recovered. Such suit may be brought and prosecuted by any adminis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trator of the estate not administered, in his own name as administrator, whenever the estate he represents has been injured by the breach of the bond of the executor or any previous administrator of the estate; or any other person or persons injured by a breach of any such bond may bring suit thereon in their own name, and any number of such persons may join in such suit.</p>
<p>Sec. 42.

<p>Sec. 43.

If from any cause such appointments be not made, or if the appraisers or any of them so appointed fail or refuse to act, or if from any other cause a new appointment is required, the County Judge shall by a like order either in term time or vacation, appoint another appraiser or appraisers, as the case may require; and in all cases any two appraisers may act. Such appraisers shall each receive two dollars per day for every day they may be necessarily enggaged, and all reasonable expenses.</p>
<p>Sec. 44. Every executor or administrator shall immediately after his appointment, with the assistance of any two or more of the appraisers appointed by the County Judge, make or cause to be made a full inven<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tory and appraisement of all the estate of the testator or intestate, both real and personal, specifying in such inventory what portion of such estate is the separate property of the deceased, and what portion, if any, is represented as common property. The appraisement of the prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty specified in the inventory shall-be sworn to and subscribed by the appraisers making the same before some officer of the county authorized by law to administer oaths; such executor or administrator shall also make and attach to such inventory a full and complete list of all claims due or owing to the testator or intestate, specifying what portion of such claims is the separate property of the deceased, and what portion, if any, is common property; such executor or administrator shall also make and attach to such inventory and list his affidavit in writing, subscribed and sworn to before some officer of the county authorized by law to ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />minister oaths, that the said inventory and list is a full and complete in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ventory and list of the property and claims of his testator or intestate that has come to his knowledge.</p>
<p>Sec. 45. The inventory and list required to be made by the preceding section shall be returned to the court by the executor or administrator within sixty clays after the date of his appointment, and may be returned either in term time or vacation; but when returned and approved it shall be noticed on the minutes of the court, and shall be recorded by the Clerk.</p>
<p>Sec. 46. Whenever other property or claims of the testator or intes<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tate than such as may be included in the inventory and list which has been returned shall come to the knowledge of the executor or adminis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trator, he shall make and return an additional inventory or list of such newly discovered property or claims, without delay, which said addi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tional inventory and list shall be made, returned and recorded, in like manner as original inventories and lists; and any executor or administra<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tor, on complaint of any person interested in the estate, shall be cited by the County Judge, and on good and sufficient proof being made that any property and claims of the estate have not been included in the inventory and list returned, shall be required to make and return an additional inventory and list thereof in like manner as original inventories and lists.</p>

<p>Sec. 47. Inventories, appraisements and lists of claims, taken and re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />turned in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this act, may be given in evidence in any suit by or against the executor or administrator; but shall not be conclusive for or against him if it be shown that there is other property not inventoried; or that there are other claims than those named in such lists; or that the property or any part thereof, was bona fide sold for more or less than the appraisement: or was not separate or common property, as specified in such inventories and lists.</p>
<p>Sec. 48. When any inventory and appraisement has been returned in the manner hereinbefore provided, any person interested in the es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tate who may deem such appraisement unjust or erroneous, may apply to the County Judge for a new appraisement, notice of which applica<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, together with a citation, shall be served on the executor or admin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />istrator requiring him to appear at a regular term of the court and show cause why a new appraisement should not be made. On the return of such citation, served, the County Judge shall inquire into the truth of the facts alleged, and if satisfied that such appraisement was manifestly un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />just or erroneous, shall appoint other appraisers and order a new ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />praisement to be made and returned in like manner as original appraise<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments. When such new appraisement is made and returned, and ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />proved, it shall be recorded, and shall stand in the place of the original appraisement, which shall be as if never made; provided, that not more than one re-appraisement shall be made.</p>
<p>Sec. 49. It shall be the duty of the executor or administrator to take such care of the property of his testator or intestate, real and personal, as a prudent man would take care of his own property, and if there be any buildings or houses belonging to the estate, it shall be his duty to keep the same in tenantable repair, extraordinary casualities excepted; and all reasonable expenses incurred by the executor or administrator in taking such care of the property, or in making such repairs, on suf<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ficient proof thereof, shall be allowed him by the County Judge.</p>
<p>Sec. 50. If there be a plantation or manufactory belonging to the estate, and the disposition thereof be not specially directed by will, and if the same be not required to be at once sold for the payment of debts, it shall be the duty of the executor or administrator to carry on the plan<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tation or manufactory, or rent the same, as shall appear to him to be most for the interest of the estate. In coming to a determination, he shall take into consideration the condition of the estate, and the neces<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sity that may exist for future sale of such property for the payment of claims or legacies, and shall not extend the time of renting or hiring any of the property beyond what may consist with the speedy settlement of the estate; and any one who is interested in the estate, may, upon good cause shown after citation to the executor or administrator, obtain an order controlling his action in this particular.</p>
<p>Sec. 51. Whenever any property is hired or rented by an executor or administrator, under the provisions of this act, such renting shall be made at public auction to the highest bidder, after having given at least ten days&#8217; notice thereof by posting a copy of such notice at the court<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />house and two other public places in the county where the same is to take place; provided, the executor or administrator may rent or hire privately, but shall be required to show, to the satisfaction of the Judge, that private renting was advantageous to the estate.</p>

Every executor or administrator shall use ordinary diligence<pb n="941" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="105" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>to collect every claim due to the estate he represents, and to recover pos<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />session of all property to which the estate has a right; provided, there is a reasonable prospect that such claim can be collected on such property recovered; and if any executor or administrator shall neglect to use such diligence, he and his sureties on his bond shall be liable, at the suit of any person interested in the estate, for the use of the estate for the amount of such claims and the value of such property as may have been lost by his neglect to use such diligence.</p>
<p>Sec. 53. The naming an executor in a will shall not operate to extin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />guish any just claim which the deceased had against him; and in all cases where an executor or administrator may be indebted to his testator or intestate, he shall account for the debt in the same manner as if it were so much money in his hands; provided, however, that if said debt was not due at the time of receiving letters, he shall only be required to ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />count for it from the date when it shall become due.</p>
<p>Sec. 54. Whenever an executor or administrator shall think it will be for the interest of the estate he represents to purchase any property, or take any claims for the use and benefit of the estate in payment of any debt due the estate, he may present a petition to the County Judge at a regular term of the court, representing these facts, and if the County Judge shall be satisfied that it will be for the interest of the estate to purchase such property or take such claims, he may make a decree au<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />thorizing such executor or administrator to make such purchase, either at public or private sale, or to take such claims for the use and benefit of the estate.</p>
<p>Sec. 55. When the mortgagee of any property shall die, the executor or administrator of such mortgagee shall be and is hereby authorized, on receiving from the mortgagor, or any person for him, the amount due to the estate he represents, to release to the mortgagor the legal title to such mortgaged property, and such release shall be valid.</p>
<p>Sec. 56. At the first term of the court after the original grant of let<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ters testamentary or of administration, it shall be the duty of the County Judge to fix the amount of an allowance to be made for the support of the widow and minor children, if there be either or any, of the deceased, which allowance shall be of an amount sufficient for their maintenance for the term of one year, and shall be paid by the executor or adminis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trator to the widow, if there be one; provided, that in case the widow is not the mother of said minor children, the portion of said allowance necessary for the support of such minor children shall be paid to their guardian, in ease they have any such guardian; otherwise, to be paid to such widow, either in money out of the first funds of the estate that may come to his hands, or in such personal effects of the deceased as such widow or guardian may choose to take at the appraisement, or a part thereof in each, as they may select. If there be no personal effects of the estate that such widow or guardian are willing to take for such al<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lowance, or not a sufficiency of them, and if there be no funds, or not sufficient funds of the estate in the hands of such executor or adminis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trator to pay such allowance, or any part thereof, then it shall be the duty of the County Judge, so soon as the inventory and list of claims are returned, to order a sale of so much of. the estate for cash as will be sufficient to raise the amount of such allowance, or a part thereof, as the case may require; provided, however, that when any such widow and mi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nor children shall have separate property adequate to their maintenance then no such allowance shall be made as is provided for in this section.</p>

<p>Sec. 57. At the first term of the court after an inventory and list of claims have been returned, it shall be the duty of the County Judge to set apart for the use and benefit of the widow and minor children, and unmarried daughters remaining with the family, if there be either or any, of the deceased, all such property as may be exempted from execution or forced sale by the Constitution or laws of the State, with the exception of any exemption of one year&#8217;s supply of provisions; and in case there should not be among the effects of the deceased all or any of the specific articles so exempted, it shall be the duty of the County Judge to make an allowance in lieu thereof to the widow and children, or such of them as there be, which allowance shall be paid by the executor or administra<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tor, either in money out of the funds of the estate that may come to his hands, or in any property of the deceased that such widow or chil<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dren may choose to take at the appraisement, or a part thereof, or both, as they may select. If there be no property of the deceased that such widow or children are willing to take for such allowance, or not a suffi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ciency, and there be no funds, or not sufficient funds of the estate in the hands of such executor or administrator to pay such allowance, or any part thereof, it shall be the duty of the County Judge, on the application of such widow or children, to order a sale of so much of the estate for cash as will be sufficient to raise the amount of such allowance, or a part thereof, as the case may require. Such allowance shall be paid in the fol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lowing manner: If there be a widow&#8217; and no children, the whole to be paid to the widow; if there be a child or children and no widow, the whole to be paid to such child, or to be equally divided among such children; if there be a widow and a child or children, one-half to be paid to the widow, and the other half to such child, or to be equally divided among such children; provided, that if the estate of such decedent be not in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />solvent, nothing in this section contained shall be so construed as to pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />hibit the partition and distribution of said estate, except the homestead, among the heirs and distributees thereof, inducting the portion herein provided to be set aside for the use of the widow and children; provided, that an allowance for homestead shall not exceed five thousand dollars, and the allowance for other exempted property shall not exceed five hun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dred dollars, exclusive of one year&#8217;s provisions. No property on which liens have been given by the husband and wife, acknowledged privately and apart from her husband, to secure creditors, shall be appropriated to make up the five thousand or five hundred dollars aforesaid, until the debts secured by such liens shall be discharged.</p>

<p>Sec. 60. If any executor or administrator fail to give the notice, re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired by the fifty-eighth section of this act to be given, he shall be re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />moved by the County Judge at any regular term of the court, on the complaint of any person interested in the estate, after being cited to answer such complaint.</p>
<p>Sec. 61. No executor or administrator shall allow any claim for money against his testator or intestate, nor shall any County Judge approve any such allowance, unless such claim is accompanied by an affidavit in writing that the claim is just, and that all legal offsets, pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments and credits known to the affiant have been allowed; which affi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />davit, if made in the county where the letters were granted, may be made before any officer of the county authorized to administer [oaths]; if made in any other county of this State, it shall be made before some County Judge, Clerk of a court, or Notary Public, and shall be attested by his official seal; if made out of the State, it shall be made before some Notary Public, Clerk or Judge of a court of record having a seal, or Commissioner of Deeds for this State, and shall be attested by the seal of his office. If any such claim is allowed or approved without such affidavit, such allowance or approval shall be of no force or effect.</p>
<p>Sec. 62. No holder of a claim for money against the estate of a de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceased person shall bring suit thereon against the executor or adminis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trator unless such claim, properly authenticated, has been presented to such executor or administrator and he has. refused to allow such claim for the whole amount, or a part thereof; or unless such claim has been presented to the County Judge and he has disapproved of the allow<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ance made by the executor or administrator, or a part thereof. In any suit that may be brought by the holder of any such claim, if he fails to recover thereon a greater amount than has been allowed by the executor or administrator, or than has been approved by the County Judge, he shall be liable for all costs of such suit.</p>
<p>Sec. 63. When any claim for money against an estate shall be present<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ed to the executor or administrator, if the same be properly authenti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cated in the manner required by this act, he shall endorse thereon or an<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nex thereto a memorandum in writing, signed by him, stating the time of its presentment, and that he allows or rejects the claim, or what portion thereof be allows or rejects, as the case may be. If the claim, or a part thereof, be allowed by the executor or administrator, it shall then be pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sented to the County Judge within three months, if said County Judge be not absent from the State or county, either in term time or vacation,<pb n="944" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="108" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>who shall endorse thereon or annex thereto a memorandum in writing signed by him, stating that be approves or disapproves of such allow<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ance, or of what portion of such allowance he approves or disapproves. If all or any portion of the claim be so allowed and approved, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive payment of the amount so allowed and approved in due course of administration. If such claim be rejected by the executor or administrator, either for the whole amount or a part thereof, or if the allowance or any part thereof made by the executor or administrator be disapproved of by the County Judge, the holder of such claim may within three months after such rejection by the executor or administrator, but not thereafter, bring a suit against the executor or administrator for the establishment thereof in any court having juris<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />diction of the same; and on the trial of such suit the memorandum in writing of the executor or administrator, or of the County Judge, en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dorsed on or annexed to such claim, may be given in evidence to prove the facts therein stated without proof of the handwriting of such exe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cutor or administrator or County Judge, unless the same be denied under oath. No execution shall issue on a judgment obtained by the plaintiff in any such suit, but such judgment shall have the same force and effect as if the amount thereof had been allowed by the executor or administrator and approved by the County Judge; provided, that when a claim has been allowed by the executor or administrator and approved by the County Judge, the owner or holder thereof shall within ten days thereafter cause a memorandum of the amount, date of claim and date of allowance and approval, [to be] recorded in the office of the County Clerk on the claim docket, a book for which purpose shall be kept by the Clerk.</p>

<p>Sec. 70. The provisions contained in this act respecting the presenta<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of claims shall not be so construed as to apply to the claim of any heir, devisee or legatee, when claiming in that capacity, nor to any claim that accrues against the estate after the granting of letters testamentary or of administration for which the executor or administrator has con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tracted, and any devisee or legatee may obtain from the County Judge of the court where the will was proved an order for the executor to deliver to him the property devised or bequeathed, whenever it shall appear to such County Judge that there will remain in the hands of the executor after such delivery a sufficient amount of the estate for the payment of all debts against said estate; provided, such devisee or legatee shall have first caused the executor and the other devisee or legatee, if any, and the heirs, if any of the estate is coming to them, to be cited to appear and show cause why such order should not be made.</p>

If such claims, or any of them, shall not be approved by the County Judge, the executor or administrator may appeal to the District Court in like manner, and such amount as may be approved by a jury shall be paid in due course of adminis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="947" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="111" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>tration. If in any appeal under the provisions of this section the exec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />utor or administrator shall fail to establish the whole of his claim, he shall be liable for costs, but if he establish the whole amount of his claim, the costs shall be paid out of the estate of the testator or intestate.</p>

Such notice shall be given by a general citation, to be issued by the Clerk of the court to all persons interested in the estate, to show cause why such sale should not be made; which citation shall be posted for thirty days in at least three public places in the county, one of which shall be the court-house door, and no two of which shall be in the same city, town or village.</p>
<p>Sec. 73.

At the return term of any such citation as is provided for in the preceding section, or at some succeeding term to which the appli<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cation may be continued by the court, if it shall appear that such cita<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion has been served and published as required by law, the court shall proceed to ascertain who are the persons by law entitled to partition and distribution, and their respective shares; and if there are any per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sons so entitled who are known and are minors, and have no guard<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ian in this State, or whose guardians are also entitled to a portion of such estate, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent them in the partition of the estate; and if there are any persons so en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />titled who are not known, or not residents of this State, and no person appears who is authorized to represent them, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent them in the partition of the estate, after which the court shall proceed to ascertain whether advancements have been made to any of the persons so entitled, their nature and value, and re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quire the same to be placed in hotchpotch as required by the law govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing descents and distributions, and also to ascertain what estate is liable to partition and distribution; the court shall then enter a decree which shall state the name and residence, if known, of each person entitled to a share of the estate, specifying those who are known to be minors, the names of their guardian or guardians ad litem, the name of the attorney appointed to represent those who are unknown, or are not residents of this State; the decree shall also state the proportional part of the estate to which each is entitled, and shall contain a full description of all the estate to be distributed; if the estate to be distributed shall consist only of money or debts due the estate, or both, the court shall fix the amount to which each is entitled, and order the payment and delivery thereof by the executor or administrator; but if the estate do not consist en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tirely of money or debts due the estate, or both, the court shall appoint three or more discreet persons as commissioners to make a partition and distribution of the estate, and shall order a writ of partition to issue commanding them to proceed forthwith to make such partition and dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tribution in accordance with the decree of the court, a copy of which<pb n="957" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="121" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>shall accompany such writ; and also commanding them to make due re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />turn of said writ, with their proceedings under it, at some term of the court to be named in the writ.</p>
<p>Sec. 104. It shall be the duty of the commissioners of partition under this act to make a fair, just and impartial partition and distribution of the estate, in the following order: First, the land or other property by allotment to each distributee of a part in each parcel, or of parts in one or more parcels, or of one or more parcels, either with or without the addition of a part or parts of other parcels, as shall be most for the in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />terest of the distributees; provided, the said real estate is capable of being so divided without manifest injury to all or any of the distribu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tees; and the said commissioners shall have power, if they think it nec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />essary, to call to their aid one or more well qualified surveyors to run the lines of any lands, and also divisional lines thereof. If the real es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tate is not capable of a fair, just and equal division in kind, but may be made so by allotting to one or more of the distributees a proportion of money or other personal property to supply the deficiency or deficiencies, the commissioners shall have power to make as near as may be an equal division of the real estate, and supply the deficiency of any share or shares, from the money or other property. The commissioners shall proceed to make a like division in kind, as near as may be, of the money and other personal property, and shall determine by lot, among equal shares, to whom each particular share shall belong.</p>
<p>Sec. 105. when, in the opinion of the Commissioners, the whole or any portion of any estate is not capable of a fair and equal division among the distributees, the said Commissioners shall make a special re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />turn of such property to the court, with the value thereof duly appraised by them. Upon such return being made to the court, any one or more of the distributees, at a regular term of the court, by the payment to the executor or administrator of the appraised value of the property so returned as incapable of division, or on the execution of his or their ob<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ligations with one or more good and sufficient sureties in favor of each of the other distributees for their share of the appraised value of such property, payable at such time, not exceeding twelve months from the date thereof, as the court may designate; provided, the court may think it for the interest of the distributees to allow a credit, shall have the right to take the said property. Should any one or more of the distribu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tees take the said property as aforesaid, it shall be the duty of the court to enter a decree stating the facts, and on the entry of such decree the property shall vest as fully and absolutely in the person or persons tak<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing the same as the deceased was vested therewith; provided, neverthe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />less, that when obligations are executed as aforesaid, a lien shall exist upon such property by operation of law, to secure the payment of such obligations; provided, also, that if any of the distributees shall file in the court his exception to the appraisement of the Commissioners before any of the distributees shall have so taken such property, a new ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />praisement of said property may be made by order of the court. If no distributee take the said property as aforesaid, the court shall order the sale of said property, either for cash or on a credit, as may be most for the interest of the distributees; and at such sale, if any distributee shall bid off any of said property he shall be required to pay or secure, as the case may be, only such amount of his bid as may exceed the amount of his share of such property; and the proceeds of sale, when collected, shall be distributed by the court among those entitled thereto.</p>

<p>Sec. 106. Said Commissioners having divided the whole or any part of the estate, shall make to the court a report in writing, subscribed and sworn to by them, containing a statement of the property divided by them, and also a particular description of the property allotted to each distributee and its value. And if it be real estate that has been divided, said report shall contain a general plat of such land, with the divisional lines plainly set down and the number of acres in each share. Upon the return of such report it shall be the duty of the court, at some regular term, to examine said report carefully, and if it be merely informal to cause said informality to be corrected; and if such division shall appear to have been fairly made according to law, and no valid exceptions are taken to it, the court shall approve it and order it to be recorded, but if said division shall not appear to have been so made, or any valid excep<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions are taken to it, the court shall set aside said report and division and order a new partition to be made.</p>
<p>Sec. 107. When any portion of the estate to be partitioned lies in a distant county and can not be fairly partitioned without a view thereof, and it is inconvenient for the Commissioners to go and examine such property, they may report such facts to the County Judge in writing, whereupon he may at some regular term of the court, if satisfied that the said property can not be conveniently divided, or that its sale would be more advantageous to the distributees, order a sale thereof for cash or on a credit of not more than twelve months, at his discretion; and when the proceeds of such sale shall have been collected they shall be distributed by him among those entitled thereto; but if no such proof be made, three or more Commissioners may be appointed in each county where any portion of the estate so reported is situated, and the same proceedings shall be had thereon as is provided in this act for Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners to make portion; and provided, that whenever any testator has by will instructed that no action be had in the courts in the settle<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of his estate, and said testator does not in said will distribute his estate or provide a means of partitioning the same, the executor may, if he desires, file his final account and vouchers as provided in this act for administrators, in the court of the county in which the will was pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bated, and ask partition and distribution of the estate, and the same shall be partitioned and distributed in the manner herein provided for in case of ordinary administration.</p>
<p>Sec. 108. When any husband or wile shall die, leaving any common property, the survivor may at any time after letters testamentary or of administration have been granted, and an inventory of the estate of the deceased has been returned, make application to the court from which such letters were granted for a partition of such common property; and if he or she shall execute and deliver to said County Judge an obliga<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion with good and sufficient sureties, payable to and approved by said County Judge, for an amount equal to the value of his or her interest in such common property, conditioned for the payment of one-half of all debts existing against such common property, then the County Judge shall proceed to make a partition of said common property into two equal moieties, one to be delivered to the survivor and the other to the executor or administrator of the deceased; and all the provisions of this act respecting the partition and distribution of estates shall apply to any partition made under the provisions of this section, so far as the same may be applicable; and whenever such partition may be made a lien shall exist upon the portion of such survivor to secure the payment<pb n="959" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="123" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>of the obligation he may have given as aforesaid; and until a partition shall be applied for as herein provided, the executor or administrator of the deceased shall have the right and it shall be his duty to recover pos<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />session of all such common property, and hold the same in trust to be ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ministered for the benefit of the creditors and others entitled thereto under the provisions of this act. After such partition any creditor of said common property may sue in his own name on such obligation, and shall have judgment thereon for the one-half of such debt as he may establish, and for the other half he shall be entitled to be paid by the executor or administrator of the deceased.</p>
<p>Sec. 109. In all cases where Commissioners to make partition are appointed under this act, the report of any three of them shall be suffi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cient. All such commissioners shall receive two dollars each for every day they may be engaged, and all their reasonable expenses shall be paid them.</p>
<p>Sec. 110. In any case where the County Judge shall appoint a guard<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ian ad litem for minors, or any attorney to represent the person absent from the State or unknown, under the provisions of this act, if such guardian ad litem or attorney shall neglect to attend to the duties of such appointment, the County Judge shall appoint others in their places by an order entered on the minutes of [the] court, and such guardian ad litem and attorneys shall be allowed by the County Judge a reasonable compensation for their services, which shall be paid out of the estate of the person they represent, and the County Judge may order execution to issue for the same.</p>
<p>Sec. 111. That all expenses incurred in the partition of estates shall be paid by the parties interested in the partition, each party paying in proportion to the share he may receive. The proportion of the estate allotted to each distributee shall be liable for his or her portion of the expenses, and if not paid the court shall have power to order execution therefor in the names of the persons entitled thereto.</p>
<p>Sec. 112. Any person or persons having a joint interest with the estate of a decedent in any property, real or personal, may make appli<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cation to the County Court from which letters testamentary or of ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ministration have been granted on said estate, to have a partition thereof; whereupon the court shall proceed to make a partition of said property between the applicant or applicants and the estate of the de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceased; and all the rules and regulations contained herein in relation to the partition and distribution of estates shall govern partitions, under this section, so far as the same may be applicable.</p>
<p>Sec. 113. When the report of any commissioners to make partition shall have been approved and ordered to be recorded, the court shall order the executor or administrator to deliver to the distributees their respective shares of the estate on demand, including all the title deeds and papers belonging to the same. If any distributee be a minor, his share shall be delivered to his guardian. If any minor distributee resi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dent of the State of Texas shall have no guardian, the executor or ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ministrator shall retain his share until a guardian shall be appointed; and he shall be allowed by the court reasonable compensation for taking care of the same. If any executor or administrator shall neglect to deliver to the person entitled thereto, his agent or attorney, when de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />manded, any portion of an estate so ordered to be delivered, such exec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />utor or administrator shall be liable to pay out of his own estate to the person so entitled damages on the amount of his share at the rate of<pb n="960" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="124" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>ten per cent. per month for each and every month he shall so neglect to deliver such share after such demand, which damages may be recovered by suit before any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Sec. 114. If any portion entitled to a portion of an estate shall not demand the same from the executor or administrator within six months after the report of the commissioners of partition has been approved and ordered to be recorded, the County Judge shall order so much of said portion as may be in money to be paid to the Treasurer of the State, and such portion as may be in other property the County Judge shall order the executor or administrator to sell on such terms as he may think best, and when the proceeds of such sale are collected he shall order the same to be paid to the Treasurer of the State; in all such cases allowing to the executor or administrator reasonable compensation for his services.</p>
<p>Sec. 115. The community property of the husband and wife shall be liable for all the debts contracted during marriage, except in such cases as are specially exempted by law. And in the settlement of community estates, it shall be the duty of the survivor, executor or administrator to keep a separate and distinct account of all the community debts allowed or paid in the settlement of such estates.</p>
<p>Sec. 116. Where the wife dies, her husband surviving, administration is unnecessary, except as to any separate estate which may have belonged to her. The husband continues to have the same power of disposition over the community property which he possessed during the continuance of marriage; but he shall be required to return an inventory and ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />praisement of all such property, and file a bond, signed by two good and sufficient sureties to be approved by and payable to the County Judge, in an amount equal to the value of the whole community property, to the effect that he will faithfully administer the same, and pay over one-half of the surplus, after the payment of the debts with which the whole is properly chargeable, to such person or persons as shall be entitled to re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceive it. And he shall be liable in such case to be called to account at any time after one year from the date of the bond, which bond shall be suable, recoverable, and in every other respect the same as the bond of the administrator. The surviving wife may retain the exclusive man<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />agement and control of the community property of herself and her de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceased husband in the same manner, and subject to the same rights, rules and regulations as provided above, until she may marry again; but upon a second marriage she shall cease to have such control and manage<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of said estate, or the right to dispose of the same, as above pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided; and said estate shall be subject to administration as in other cases of deceased persons&#8217; estate.</p>
<p>Sec. 117. Any person capable of making a will may so provide, by his or her will, that no other action shall be had in the County Court, in relation to the settlement of his or her estate, than the probating and registration of his or her will, and the return of an inventory of the estate; and in all such cases any person having a debt or claim against said estate may enforce the payment of the same by suit against the ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ecutor of such will, and when judgment is recovered against the exec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />utor, the execution shall run against the estate of the testator in the hands of such executor; provided, that no such executor shall be re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired to plead to any suit brought against him for money until the expiration of twelve months from the date of the probate of such will. But in cases where no bond and security has been required of such ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="961" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="125" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>ecutor at the time of the probate of such will, any person having a debt, claim or demand against said estate, to the justice of which oath has been made by himself, his agent or attorney, or any person having an interest therein, whether in person or as representative of another, may, by complaint filed in the court where such will was probated, cause such executor to be cited to appear before such court, at some regular term, and on making it appear to the satisfaction of said court that such execu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tor is wasting or misapplying said estate, and that thereby said creditor may probably lose his debt, or such person his or her interest in the es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tate, it shall be the duty of said court to order such executor to give bond, with two on more good and sufficient sureties, for an amount equal to double the full value of said estate, to be approved by and payable to the County Judge of the county, conditioned that said executor will well and truly administer such estate, and that he will not waste, misman<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />age or misapply the same; which bond may be recovered upon as other bonds given by executors and administrators; and should such execu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tor fail to give such bond within ten days after the order requiring him to do so, then it shall be the duty of the County Judge to remove him from the executorship of such estate, and to appoint some competent person in his stead, whose duty it shall be to administer said estate ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cording to the provisions of such will, and who, before he enters upon the administration of said estate, shall be required to give such bond as herein above provided for. And if such will does not distribute the entire estate of the testator, or provide a means for partition of said estate, the execu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tor shall have the right to file his final account in the court in which the will was probated, and ask partition and distribution of the estate, and the same shall be partitioned and distributed in the manner provided herein for the partition and distribution of estates administered accord<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing to the provisions of this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 118. It shall be the duty of the County Judge of any county from which any county or part thereof has been or may hereafter be taken, to transmit all original papers relating to the settlement of es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tates of deceased persons, who were, at the time of their decease, resi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dents of that part of the territory of the county which has been or may hereafter be taken to form any new county, to the Probate Court of such new county, upon the petition of any executor or administrator, or guardian, or a majority of the heirs of any such estate; and he shall also transmit, with such original papers, a transcript, certified under the seal of the court, of the records of all proceedings had in relation to such estates in his court; provided, that at the time of filing such peti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion the party filing it shall pay all fees due on account of such estate.</p>
<p>Sec. 119. Previous to the transmission of any such original papers, in the manner provided for in the preceding section, the Judge to whom such petition is presented shall cause a registry of all such original pa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pers, as have not been recorded, to be made in his office, for which the same fee shall be allowed as is allowed for other recording.</p>
<p>Sec. 120. In all cases where the papers and proceeding relating to the settlement of an estate shall be transmitted to any court in the man<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ner provided for in this act, such estate shall be proceeded in and set<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tled in the probate court of such county in like manner as if the set<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tlement of such estates had been originally commenced in such county, and the transcript of the record transmitted in the manner provided<pb n="962" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="126" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>for in this act shall have the same force and effect in evidence as the record itself might or could have.</p>
<p>Sec. 121. Executors and administrators shall be entitled to receive, and may retain in their hands, five per cent. upon all sums they may actually receive in cash, and the same upon all sums they may pay away in cash, in the course of their administration; provided, that no commissions shall be allowed for money received which was on hand at the time of the death of the testator or intestate, nor for paying out money to the heirs and legatees as such. All reasonable expenses in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />curred by an executor or administrator in the preservation, safe-keep<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing and management of the estate, and all reasonable attorney&#8217;s fees that may be incurred in the course of the administration, shall be al<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lowed by the County Judge, on proof that there was a necessity therefor.</p>
<p>Sec. 122. Whenever any executor or administrator shall file in the court receipts showing that he has disposed of any portion of the es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tate, under the provisions of this act, the court shall order the same to be recorded; and whenever he shall have so filed receipts showing that all of the estate has been disposed of by him, under the provisions of this act, he shall, provided the court approve said receipts and the account filed, be finally discharged from his trust by the County Judge; and provided further, when any person holding an allowed and approved claim against the estate does not come forward to receive payment for the same, the administrator or executor may deposit the money for the payment of said claim with the Clerk of the County Court, and take his receipt therefor.</p>
<p>Sec. 123. Any person capable of making a will may so provide by his will that no other action shall be had in the County Court in rela<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion to the settlement of his estate than the probate and registration of his will and the return of an inventory of the estate; but in all such cases any person having a debt against said estate may, by complaint in writing, filed in the court where such will was proved, cause all the per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sons entitled to any portion of such estate under the will, or as heirs at law, to be cited to appear before such court, at some regular term, and execute an obligation, with two or more good and sufficient sure<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties, for an amount equal to the full value of such estate, to be ascer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tained by the inventory, such obligation to be payable to the County Judge, and conditioned that the persons who execute the obligation shall pay all debts that may be established against such estate, in the manner herein provided; and on the return of such citations served, unless such persons so entitled to any portion of the estate, or some of them, or some other persons for them, shall execute such obligation to the satisfaction of the County Judge, such estate shall be settled under the direction of the court as other estates are required to be settled; but if such obligation shall be executed it shall be filed and recorded in said court, and no other action shall be had in said court in relation to such estate. All costs of such proceedings shall be paid by the persons so entitled to such estate, according to their respective interests in it. Every creditor of such estate shall have the right to sue on such obliga<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, and shall be entitled to judgment thereon for such debt as he may establish against the testator by a verdict of the jury in such suits, or such creditors may have their action against those in possession of the estate.</p>
<p>Sec. 124. At any time after the return of the inventory of the estate<pb n="963" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="127" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>of a deceased person, any one entitled to a portion of said estate, as heirs, devisee or legatee, or his or her guardian if he or she be a minor, may by a complaint in writing tiled in the court where such inventory has been returned, cause the executor or administrator of the estate to be cited to appear at some regular term of the court and render an exhibit, under oath, of the condition of such estate; and on the return of such citation served, the person so entitled to such estate, or any of them, or any persons for them, may execute and deliver to the County Judge an obli<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gation payable to him, with two or more good and sufficient sureties, to be approved by the County Judge, for an amount at least equal to double the appraised value of the estate as ascertained by the inventory, condi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tioned that the persons who execute such obligation shall pay all the debts against the estate not paid that have been allowed by the executor or administrator and approved by the County Judge, or that have been established by suit against the executor or administrator, or that may be established against the estate by suit in the manner herein provided; and may pay to the executor or administrator any balance that may be decreed to be due to him on his exhibit, in obedience to said citation; whereupon such obligation shall be filed and recorded in said court, and the court shall on the application of any of the persons so entitled to any portion of the estate, cause a partition and distribution of such estate to be made among the persons entitled thereto, in accordance with the provisions of this act respecting the partition and distribution of estates; and a lien shall exist on all of said estate in the hands of the distributees to secure the ultimate payment of the aforesaid obligation. Any credi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tor of such estate whose claim is yet unpaid and has been allowed by the executor or administrator previous to the filing of such obligation, and approved by the County Judge, or established by suit against the execu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tor or administrator, previous to the filing of such obligation, shall have the right to sue on -such obligation in his own name, and shall be entitled to judgment thereon for the amount of his claim; or any other creditor of such estate whose claim is not barred by the laws of limita<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion shall have the right to sue on such obligation, and shall be entitled to judgment thereon for such debt as he may establish against the es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tate by a verdict of the jury in such suit; or any of said creditors may sue the distributee, but no one of them shall be liable beyond his just pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />portion, according to the estate he may have received in the distribution.</p>
<p>Sec. 125. When a person dies, leaving a lawful will, all of his estate devised or bequeathed by such will shall vest immediately in the devisees or legatees; and all the estate of such person not devised or bequeathed shall vest immediately in his heirs at law; but all of such estate, whether devised or bequeathed or not, except such as may be exempted by law from the payment of debts, shall still be liable and subject in their hands to the payment of the debts of such testator; and whenever a person dies intestate all of his estate shall vest immediately in his heirs at law, but with the exceptions aforesaid shall still be liable and subject, in their hands, to the payment of the debts of the intestate. But upon the issu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ance of letters testamentary or of administration on any such estate, the executor or administrator shall have a right to the possession of the estate as it existed at the death of the testator or intestate, with the ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ception aforesaid; and it shall be his duty to recover possession of and hold such estate in trust, to be disposed of under the provisions of this act.</p>

<p>Sec. 126. When complaint shall be made in writing to any County Judge that any person has the last will of any testator or testatrix, or any papers belonging to the estate of a testator or intestate, said County Judge shall cause said person to be cited to appear before him, either in term time or vacation, and show cause why he should not deliver such will to the court for probate, or why he should not deliver such papers to the executor or administrator, and upon the return of such citation served, unless such will or papers are so delivered, or good cause be shown to the court for not delivering the same, the County Judge, if satisfied that such person had such will or papers at the time of the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />plaint being filed, may cause him to be arrested and imprisoned until he shall so deliver them.</p>
<p>Sec. 127. All the provisions in this act relative to an executor or ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ministrator shall apply and extend to an executrix or administratrix, or executors or administrators respectively, unless expressly provided for; and whenever any party in the singular number or a male party is men<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tioned, the rule shall apply to a female, or to two or more having a joint interest, or jointly concerned, applying or called upon, so far as the rule can with propriety apply, or so far as is not otherwise directed.</p>
<p>Sec. 128. Any one interested in the estate of a deceased person may at any time within two years after the settlement of the County Judge of any account of the executor or administrator of such estate, have the same revised and corrected by the District Court of the county in which the letters of such executor or administrator were granted, upon making proof before such District Court that there was any error or fraud in such account or settlement; provided, that he shall first obtain from the Clerk of the court in which such account was settled a tran<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />script of all the papers relating to such account and settlement, and file the same with a petition in the office of the Clerk of said District Court, and cause such executor or administrator, or his legal representatives, to be cited as in other suits in said District Court.</p>

</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That the eighth section of the act passed February. 5, 1858, to which this is amendatory, shall read as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sec. 8. If information in writing be given to any County Judge that any person in his county is a lunatic, or non compos mentis, and that the welfare of himself or herself or of others requires that he or she be placed under restraint, and said County Judge shall believe such in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />formation to be true, he shall order such person to be brought before him and twelve competent jurors of his county to be summoned, who shall be sworn to enquire and a true verdict render whether such person is of sound mind or not; whereupon, the matter shall be tried, and if the jury shall return a verdict that the person is not of sound mind, and that he or she should be placed under restraint, the same shall be recorded on the books of the County Court, and the County Judge shall there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />upon order him or her to be sent to the lunatic asylum, unless some friend or legal representative (to whom the County Judge in his discre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion may deliver such person) will give bond payable to the State, with sufficient security, to be approved by said County Judge, with the con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dition to restrain and take proper care of such person until the cause of confinement shall cease, or he or she is delivered to the Sheriff of the county, or other person, to be proceeded with according to law. Upon the trial and inquiry herein provided for, it shall be the duty of the County Attorney to appear for and represent the State, and the exam<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ination of the insane and the testimony of the witnesses shall be re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />duced to writing and filed. The proceedings of the County Judge in relation to insane persons shall be minuted in the record of his court appertaining to estates of deceased persons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That Section 9 of said act shall be amended so as to read as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sec. 9. It shall be the duty of the County Judge, on ordering the person to be sent to the asylum, to ascertain and to state in the authen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ticated proceedings to be sent to the Superintendent of the State Luna<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tic Asylum: First, the age, nativity and civil condition of the lunatic; Second, the number of attacks, and how long the present one has existed; Third, whether the insanity is hereditary or not; Fourth, the number of his family, if he has one, and their ability to maintain themselves; Fifth, the value of his or her estate, if any; and Sixth, the ability of per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sons legally liable for his or her support; and he shall make an order specifying the amount which his guardian, if any, shall pay out of the estate of such person for his support in the asylum, and shall cause a minute to be made of the facts ascertained.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sec. 3. That Section 10 of said act shall be amended so as to read as follows:</p>
<pb n="975" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="139" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>
<p>&#8220;Sec. 10.

Thereupon the County Judge shall issue his warrant to the Sheriff or other suitable individual, or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dering him to convey said person to the Lunatic Asylum, without de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lay, and when satisfied of the necessity for assistants, he shall prescribe in such warrant the number to be allowed, which in no case shall ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceed two; and he shall see that the patient is provided with two good and full suits of summer and one of winter clothing."</p>
<p>Sec. 4. That Section 17 of the said act shall be amended so as to read as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sec. 17. The custody and maintenance of all lunatics who shall be found to be indigent, as well those now in the asylum, as those to be hereafter admitted, shall be at the expense of the State, under the rules and restrictions as are prescribed herein. In cases where any patient is now in the custody and care of said asylum, if said patient is held and treated at the expense of the county from which he or she was sent, it shall be the duty of the Superintendent of said asylum, as soon as practicable after the passage of this law, to communicate by mail with the County Judge of said county, giving him the names of such persons so confined from said county; whereupon it shall be the duty of the County Judge to cause a jury of twelve men to be summoned before him and shall proceed to take the necessary evidence, to hear and determine whether such lunatic is a person without any means to support him or her, and whether any person in said county is legally liable to support said lunatic. Said jury shall be sworn to try the mat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ter and a true verdict render; and said County Judge shall cause the testimony to be written down and filed, and the verdict of said jury to be recorded. And if said verdict shall be that said lunatic is in indi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gent circumstances, and without any property to support him or her, the County Judge shall certify the facts, together with a copy of testi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mony and the verdict of said jury to the said Superintendent of the asylum, and thereupon said lunatic shall be kept and maintained at the expense of the State.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sec. 5. That in all cases, as provided for in Section 1 of this act, it shall be the duty of [the] County Judge to cause said jury to enquire, in addition to the matters to be enquired about, as set forth in said Section 1, whether such person, so found by the jury to be of unsound mind, is also a person without means to support him or her, and whether any person in said county is legally liable to support said lunatic; and it shall be the duty of said County Judge to certify all of said proceed<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ings to the Superintendent of the asylum, and if it shall be found by the verdict of said jury that said lunatic is an indigent person, then, in that case, the expense and maintenance of such person shall be paid by the State. If it shall appear, upon such inquisition, that any person is legally liable for the support of such insane person, the facts shall all be certified to the Clerk of the District Court, who shall have authority to order the payment thereof by the person liable, and if the same be adjudged against the property of the patient or his or her guardian or legal representative, the payment thereof may be, as in other cases, en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="976" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="140" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>forced by execution; provided, that an appeal may be taken to the Dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trict Court from the order of the Clerk.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. For all persons who are not indigent, the Superintendent may make a special contract at any rate not less than five dollars ($5) per week. In all cases of indigent lunatics, the expenses of removing the patient from the asylum home and for the necessary clothing with which he shall be furnished by the asylum, shall be paid by the State. The expenses of conveying indigent lunatics to the asylum shall be paid by the county; and the Sheriff or other person conveying said lunatic shall, in each case, make out and cause to be delivered to the County Judge for allowance, a statement, verified by affidavit, of the actual ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />penses incurred in the transportation of such lunatics to the asylum for payment; and the same shall be paid by the county.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. In receiving patients into the asylum, preference shall be given, in all cases, to indigent patients.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. Inasmuch as a number of indigent lunatics are being sup<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ported at the expense of many of the counties of this State, and as the Constitution requires that all such lunatics shall be supported at the expense of the State, an emergency and an imperative public necessity exists, requiring the immediate passage of this act; therefore, this act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.</p>

A suit against a private corporation created by or under the laws of this State may be commenced in any precinct where it has a place of business, or in which its chief officer resides, or in which the liability was incurred or the cause of action arose.

A person who has no fixed residence may be sued in any precinct in the county where he may be found. The residence of a single person is where he or she boards; provided that residents of incorporated cities and towns may be sued before any Justice of the Peace within the limits of the corporation.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. Any party or parties to a suit before a Justice of the Peace shall be entitled to a change of venue to a Justice of the Peace at the county seat, unless he is similarly disqualified, in which event it shall be to the nearest Justice of the Peace in the county not subject to the same objection; or otherwise disqualified, on his or her or their affidavit, supported by two other credible persons, to the effect that they do not believe that the persons applying for such change of venue can have a fair and impartial trial before the Justice or in the Justice&#8217;s precinct where the suit is pending.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. All process from a Justice of the Peace, except in criminal cases, shall be under the hand of such Justice, directed to some lawful officer, whose duty it shall be to execute and return the same. All such process shall be returnable, except in cases where it is otherwise provided for by law, to some regular term of such Justice&#8217;s Court, and shall be served by leaving a copy thereof with the defendant at least five days before the return day, exclusive of the day of service, and when suit is brought against a private corporation, county, city or town, the copy of the citation shall be delivered to the chief officer or direc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tor or managing agent of such private corporation, the Clerk of the County Court of such county, or Mayor of such city or town. The voluntary appearance of a defendant is equivalent to personal service of the citation and a waiver of all defects therein. Whenever in any civil suit before a Justice of the Peace, the plaintiff, his agent or attorney, shall make oath in writing before such Justice of the Peace, that the defendant is absent from this State, or that he is a transient person, so that the or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dinary process of law cannot be served upon him, such Justice shall issue a citation, directed to some lawful officer, commanding him to cite the de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fendant to appear at a regular term of his Court, named in citation, to an<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />swer the plaintiff&#8217;s complaint, stating the nature and amount thereof; such citation shall be returnable to the regular term of such Justice&#8217;s Court therein named and shall be published in some newspaper printed in the county, if there be one, for at least three successive weeks before the return day; if there be no newspaper printed in the county, then it shall be published in like manner, in some newspaper printed in the near<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />est county where a newspaper is published. In cases of emergency any Justice of the Peace may depute any person of good character to execute any process, civil or criminal; provided, that in every such case, the Jus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tice shall certify on the back of such process, that the person is so deputed by him, and the person so deputed shall take and subscribe an oath that he will execute such process according to law, which oath, with the cer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tificate of the Justice that it was administered, shall be endorsed on or annexed to such process. In all suits brought in a Justice&#8217;s Court against two or more defendants jointly liable, and where one or more of the defendants reside out of the county where suit is instituted, the Justice of the Peace before whom suit is brought shall issue process to the Sheriff or any Constable of the county or counties where such de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fendant or defendants are alleged to reside; and the officer to whom<pb n="995" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="159" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>such process is directed shall serve the same as in other cases, and make his return to the court from which the process issued. Where there are two or more defendants in a suit, and one or more are served with pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cess in due time, and others not so served, the plaintiff may either dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />continue as to those not so served, and proceed against those that are, or he may continue the suit until the next term of the court, and take new process against those not served; and no defendant, against whom any suit may be discontinued, according to the provisions of this sec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, shall be thereby exonerated from any liability under which he was, hut may, at any time, be proceeded against as if no such suit had been brought, and no such discontinuance entered as to such defendants; provided, that this section shall not be so construed as to allow a plaintiff to discontinue as to the principal and take judgment against the en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dorser or surety, who is jointly sued.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. Any Justice of the Peace before whom any suit or proceed<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing is pending may, for good cause shown by either party and supported by affidavit, continue the same to the next term of his court, and if such cause or proceeding is such as can be tried by such Justice at any other time than at a regular term, he shall have the like power to con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tinue the same for a reasonable time. When both parties in any suit before a Justice of the Peace appear in person, or by agent or attorney, at the time appointed for the trial thereof, or at the time to which it may have been continued, if the amount in controversy shall not ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceed ten dollars, or if the amount in controversy shall exceed ten dol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lars, and neither party shall make application to- have the cause tried by a jury, the Justice shall proceed to hear the allegations and proofs of the parties, and the defendant, upon giving notice thereof to the plaintiff before the trial commences, shall be allowed to present and prove any claim or demand not exceeding two hundred dollars, ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />clusive of interest, against the plaintiff that is similar in its character to the claim or demand of the plaintiff, and the suit shall be determined by the Justice, as from the testimony shall seem to be right. If it shall appear from the testimony that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, judg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment shall be entered in his favor for such amount as shall appear to be due him with costs; but if it shall appear from the testimony that the defendant is entitled to recover, then judgment shall be entered in his favor for such amount as shall appear to be due him (if any), with costs. If the amount in controversy shall exceed ten dollars, and either party shall make application to have the case tried by jury, then the same shall be so tried in like manner as hereinbefore provided, and upon the return of the verdict of the jury, the Justice- shall enter judg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment thereon with costs; provided, however, that whenever it shall ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pear on- any such trial that the defendant&#8217;s claim or demand was ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired after the commencement of the plaintiff&#8217;s suit, the defendant shall be liable for all the costs.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. The pleading in a Justice&#8217;s Court shall be oral, except where either party desires to plead any of the following matters, which must be contained in a written statement under oath, before the plain<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tiff announced ready for trial. First&#8212;That the suit is not commenced in the proper precinct. Second&#8212;That the plaintiff hath not legal capac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ity to sue. Third&#8212;That the party is not entitled to recover in the capacity in which he sues. Fourth&#8212;That there is another suit pending in this State between the same parties for the same cause of action, or counter claim. Fifth&#8212;That there is a defect of parties, plaintiff or<pb n="996" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="160" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>defendant. Sixth&#8212;That a written instrument, purporting to be signed by him or by his authority, was not executed by him or by his authority. Seventh&#8212;That an endorsement or assignment of a written instrument was not made by the party by whom it purports to have been made, nor by his authority. Eighth&#8212;A denial of partnership, whether the same be on the part of the plaintiff or defendant. In all proceedings before a Justice of the Peace, in which either party may be entitled to a jury, and shall make application for one, such jury shall be composed of six men, and the Justice shall forthwith issue a writ, directed to some lawful officer of the county, commanding him to summon forthwith six legally qualified jurors to serve as a jury, and if any person so summoned shall fail or refuse to attend, he may be fined by the justice three dollars, for the use of the county, for such failure or neglect, after being cited to do so, and not being able to show good cause for such failure or neglect. In all trials, whether civil or criminal, each party shall be entitled to three peremptory challenges, and also any number of challenges for cause, which cause shall be judged of by the Justice. If from challenges or any other cause, a sufficient number of persons are not in attendance, the Justice shall order some lawful officer to summon a sufficient num<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ber of qualified jurors to make up the jury.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. When a jury is empanneled, the Justice shall administer to them an oath or affirmation in form as follows: &#8220;You and each of you do solemnly swear (or affirm as the case may be) that you will well and truly try the cause about to be submitted to you, and a true verdict render therein, according to the law and the evidence, so help you God.&#8221; Whenever a jury has been summoned in a Justice&#8217;s court, the same jury may be called on to try all causes before such Justice in which a jury is required on the same day, without the necessity of a new writ in each case; provided, however, that jurors shall be sworn for each cause. In all cases before Justices of the Peace, other than prosecutions for offenses against the laws of this State, the party applying for a jury shall, before the trial commences, pay a jury fee of three dollars, which shall be equally divided between the jury trying the cause, and if the party pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing such fee shall recover judgment, the jury fee shall be taxed in the bill of costs, and when collected, shall be refunded to him; and in all cases, civil and criminal, before a Justice of the Peace, which shall be tried by jury, when the jury fee is not required to be paid before the trial commences, a like jury fee shall be taxed in the bill of costs, and when collected, shall be equally divided between the jurors who tried the same.</p>
<p>Sec. 14. In all suits before a Justice of the Peace, it shall be his duty, on the application of cither party, to issue subpoenas for witnesses re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />siding in the county, and all such subpoenas shall be executed by the officer to whom they may be directed, by reading the same to the wit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ness, and shall be returned on or before the time when the witness is required to attend, showing how the same has been executed. Justices of the Peace shall have power to enforce the attendance of witnesses, and compel them to give evidence in their courts, by attachment and imprisonment; provided, that in civil cases no witness shall be attached, fined or imprisoned unless he shall have refused to obey a subpoena after having been tendered his fees for one day&#8217;s attendance before the day of the trial of any civil suit before a Justice of the Peace. Upon all trials before a Justice of the Peace, if any exceptions are taken to any deposition or evidence, the same shall be decided by the Justice. All witnesses who are subpoenaed to attend a Justice&#8217;s court shall be en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="997" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="161" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>titled to receive one dollar per day for each day&#8217;s attendance, which, if claimed by the witness at the time of trial, shall be taxed in the bill of costs against the party cast in the suit.</p>
<p>Sec. 15. Whenever in any civil suit, before any Justice of the Peace, the evidence of a female is required, or the evidence of any witness re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />siding in the county, who is unable by reason of age, infirmities or sick<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ness to attend the court, or the evidence of a witness residing out of the county, the party interested may take the deposition of any such wit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ness, by filing with the Justice before whom such suit is pending, inter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rogatories to such witness, and serving a copy of the same on the op<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />posite party, his agent or attorney, with a notice that he intends to apply for a commission to take the answers of the witness to such in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />terrogatories. Such notice and copy may be served by any lawful officer of the county, or by any other person, but when served by any other person than an officer, an affidavit shall be endorsed on or annexed to such notice by the person serving the same, stating the fact of the ser<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vice of such notice, and a copy of interrogatories, which affidavit, unless disapproved, shall be evidence of such service; and the opposite party may file cross-interrogatories with the Justice at any time before the commission issued.</p>
<p>Sec. 16. At the expiration of five days from the service of any such notice and interrogatories, on the application of the party who filed the same, his agent or attorney, it shall be the duty of the Justice to issue a commission, with a copy of the interrogatories and cross-interroga<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tories, if any have been filed, directed to some Notary Public, Clerk of the District or County Court of the county where such witness resides, requiring such Notary Public or Clerk to take the answers of such wit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ness to the interrogatories and cross-interrogatories that accompany such commission, to cause the witness to be sworn to his answers, and to subscribe them; and every Notary Public or Clerk of the District Court to whom any such commission may be directed, shall execute the same according to the directions therein contained, and for that purpose he shall have like powers as Notaries Public and Clerks of the District Court have to execute commissions to take depositions when issued from the District Court. He shall certify under his hand and official seal, the manner in which he has executed such commission, and seal up such certificate and answer with the commission and inter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rogatories, write his name across the seal of the envelope, direct the same to the Justice from whom the commission issued, and forward it either by mail or private conveyance. If sent by mail, he shall cause the Postmaster or his deputy, mailing the same, to endorse there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />on that he received it from the hands of the officer who took such answers; if sent by private hands, the person delivering the same to the Justice shall make affidavit in writing before such Justice that he received the package from the hands of the officer who took such answers, and that it has undergone no change since. All evidence so taken and returned to any Justice&#8217;s Court may be read in evidence on the trial of the suit on which it was taken, and shall have the same force and effect as if the witness were examined in open court; pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, the answers are responsive to the interrogatories; and provided, also, that the interrogatories and answers shall be subject to all legal exceptions; but when such depositions are filed with the Justice before the trial commences, no exceptions shall be heard as to the manner of taking and returning such depositions, unless they are taken before the<pb n="998" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="162" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>trial commences. All the rules of evidence prescribed for the govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of District Courts, where the same do not conflict with the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visions of this act, shall govern the proceedings in Justice&#8217;s Courts, so far as the same are applicable.</p>
<p>Sec. 17. Any Justice may, for a good cause shown, supported by an affidavit in writing, grant a new trial in any civil suit tried before him, whenever he shall consider that justice has not been done in the trial of such case; provided, however, that all applications for a new trial shall be made within ten days after the rendition of judgment; and one day&#8217;s notice of the application shall be given to the opposite party, his agent or attorney; provided, also, that not more than one new trial shall be granted to either party. And in all cases where a new trial shall be granted, the cause shall be continued to the next term of the court. All judgments and final orders given by any Justice of the Peace, in any suit or prosecution, civil or criminal, shall be given in open court. Any person may appear before any Justice of the Peace and confess a judgment for any amount within the jurisdiction of a Justice of the Peace without the issuance of any citation; and all such confessions of judgment shall be recorded in like manner as other judgments.</p>
<p>Sec. 18. When a defendant who has been served with a citation from a Justice of the Peace, according to law, shall neglect to appear at or before ten o&#8217;clock a. m. of the return day of the citation, at or be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore the same hour of any day to which the cause may have been contin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ued, the Justice shall proceed in the following manner: First&#8212;If the plaintiff&#8217;s cause of action is liquidated, and proved by any instrument in writing, purporting to have been executed by the defendant, the Justice shall, whether the plaintiff appear or not, after allowing the proper credits for all payments endorsed on such instrument in writing, render judgment by default against the defendant for the amount which shall appear by such instrument in writing to be due to the plaintiff, together with the costs of suit. Second&#8212;If the plaintiff&#8217;s cause of action is not liquidated, and the plaintiff appear in person, or by agent or attorney, the Justice shall proceed to hear his allegations and proofs, and shall determine the cause as shall appear from the testimony to be right; and if it shall appear, from such testimony, that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, judgment shall be rendered by default against the defendant, for such amount as the testimony shows the plaintiff to be entitled to, with costs; but if it do not appear that the plaintiff ought to recover, judgment shall be given for the defendant, against the plaintiff, for costs. Third&#8212;If the plaintiff fail to appear at or before 10 o&#8217;clock a. m. of the return day of the citation, or at or before the same hour of any day to which the cause may have been continued, except in the case herein<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />before provided, the Justice may, upon motion of the defendant, his agent or attorney, render judgment of non-suit against the plaintiff, with costs.</p>
<p>Sec. 19. Every Justice of the Peace shall have power, upon good cause being shown, supported by affidavit, to set aside a judgment by default or by non-suit, at any time within ten days after the same was rendered; provided, that one day&#8217;s notice of such application shall be given to the opposite party, lids agent or attorney, by the party applying, and in such case the suit shall be continued to the next term of such Justice&#8217;s Court; and provided further, that all motions, where notice is required to the opposite party, shall be filed with the Justice of the Peace in writing. In all cases where a suit shall be brought before a Justice of the Peace<pb n="999" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="163" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>for the recovery of specific articles, on the trial thereof, the jury or Jus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tice, as the case may be, shall, if they find for the plaintiff, assess the value of such articles separately; and if the plaintiff recover, judgment shall be rendered for the specific article or articles, if to be had, hut if not, then for their value, and the Justice shall issue thereon his writ, directed to some lawful officer, commanding him to put the plaintiff in the possession of the article or articles so recovered, if to be found, hut if not, then to proceed to make the value of such article or articles with the legal interest from date of judgment, and costs as under execution, and every Justice shall from time to time, when required by a party having a judgment in his court, issue such executions or other writs as may be necessary to enforce such judgment, until the same shall have been satisfied. No Justice shall render a judgment upon any attach<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment or sequestration unless the defendant shall have been cited either personally or by publication.</p>
<p>Sec. 20. All judgments hereafter rendered by any Justice of the Peace shall operate as a lien upon all the real estate of the defendant situated in the county where such judgment shall have been rendered, whenever a certified copy of such judgment shall be filed for registration in the office of the Clerk of the County Court of such county; and it shall be the duty of such Clerk to record certified copies of such judg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments as may be filed with him for registration at the earliest practicable period, in the book used in said office for the record of mortgages, and to cause a regular and alphabetical index to be made of the names of the plaintiffs and defendants in said judgments, and also a reference to the page on which such judgment is recorded.</p>
<p>Sec. 21. That any party, his agent or attorney, may appeal from any final judgment in any civil cause rendered by a Justice of the Peace to the County Court of the county in which such final judgment shall have been rendered, upon notice thereof being given in open court; provided, that the amount of the judgment appealed from or the amount in con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />troversy shall exceed twenty dollars, exclusive of costs; provided further, that the party appealing shall, within ten days after the rendition of said judgment, file with such Justice a bond, with one or more good and sufficient sureties, in a sum at least double the amount of such judgment (if any) and interest and costs, payable to the appellee, con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ditioned that the party appealing shall prosecute his appeal to effect, or shall pay and satisfy the judgment or decree that may be rendered against the obligors in such bond; and in all cases where an appeal shall be taken from a Justice&#8217;s Court to the County Court, it shall be the duty of the Justice from whom such appeal shall be taken imme<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />diately to make out a transcript of all the entries made on his docket in such case and file the same, together with all the original papers of the cause, with the Clerk of the County Court on or before the first day of the term of such court next after such appeal was taken; but if there is not time for such transcript and natters to be filed at such first term, then they shall be so filed at the next succeeding term of said court; provided, however, there shall be no appeal from the Justices&#8217; Courts in actions of forcible entry and detainer and forcible detainer; but either party in such cases being dissatisfied with the judgment of the court, may take the same to the County Court for trial de novo by writ of certiorari, by making affidavit in writing, setting forth sufficient cause to entitle him to said writ, and entering into bond with sufficient sure<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties within ten days after the rendition of such judgment, to be ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="1000" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="164" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>proved by the Clerk of said court, payable to the adverse party, con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ditioned that said party procuring said writ will prosecute the same with effect, and in case of failure, to pay all costs and damages occa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioned by the proceedings under such writ of certiorari.</p>
<p>Sec. 22. A Justice of the Peace may grant a stay of execution on any judgment for money rendered by himself on a civil suit for three months; provided, the person against whom such judgment was rendered, shall with one or more good and sufficient sureties, to be approved by such Justice, appear before him and acknowledge themselves and each of them bound to the successful party in such sum as shall secure the amount of the judgment, interests and costs, which acknowledgment shall be entered by the Justice on his docket, and shall have the force and effect of a judgment against the person making the acknowledg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment; upon which execution shall issue for the amount of the orig<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />inal judgment, interest and costs, in case the same shall not be paid on or before the expiration of such stay; provided, however, that no such<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stay shall be granted unless the same is applied for within ten days after the entry of the original judgment. All executions issued by a Justice of the Peace shall be directed to some lawful officer of the State, and shall be returnable to his court in sixty days. It shall be the duty of the officer to whom any such execution is directed, to execute and return the same, on or before the return day thereof; and all the provisions of the laws regulating executions from the District Courts, where the same are not inconsistent with the provisions of this act, shall apply to and govern executions from Justices of the Peace, so far as the same are practicable.</p>
<p>Sec. 23. No Justice of the Peace shall issue an execution in any case where the judgment may be for money, except in prosecutions for crim<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ial offenses and for costs, before the eleventh day after the day on which judgment was rendered, unless the party in whose favor judg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment was given, shall have filed an affidavit with the Justice, setting forth that he believes the party against whom the judgment was ren<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dered, will within ten days sell or otherwise dispose of or remove his, her or their property out of the county; whereupon, it shall be the duty of said Justice to issue an execution forthwith.

<p>Sec. 24. When a stay of execution upon any judgment rendered in the Justice&#8217;s Court is taken, the same shall not prevent the taking of a writ of certiorari; but the defendant shall have the right to take out his writ of certiorari to the Justice&#8217;s court at any time within ninety days from the decision of the cause by the Justice, of the Peace. Every per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />son who shall have a cause of action against another within the juris<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />diction of a Justice of the Peace, who shall make oath in writing before such Justice that he is unable to pay the costs of such action, shall be entitled to all process necessary for the trial of such action, and to have a trial thereof free of costs. No suit shall be brought before any Justice of the Peace where he may be interested, or where he may be related to either the plaintiff or defendant, within the third degree of consan<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />guinity or affinity, but in all such cases suit shall be brought before the nearest Justice not so interested or related; and in all cases pending be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="1001" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="165" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>fore any Justice where he is thus disqualified from sitting in the case, any Justice in the county may sit and try the same.</p>
<p>Sec. 25. Each Justice of the Peace shall hold a term of his court once in each month, and may transact such business out of said term as is authorized by law; and the Justices of the Peace shall hold their courts at such times and places as may be prescribed by the Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners&#8217; Courts, and such Justices may hold their courts from day to day until all business shall be disposed of. Should the office of the Justice of the Peace within any county of this State become vacant by death, resignation or otherwise, it shall be lawful for any Justice of the Peace within said county to proceed to try and dispose of all such unfinished business as may be on the docket of such Justice who may have vacated his office as aforesaid, until a successor shall have been appointed and qualified. If, from sickness or absence from the county, any Justice of the Peace shall fail to hold a regular term of his court, then, and in that case, any other Justice of the Peace within the same county shall be and is hereby authorized to preside in the place and stead of such sick or absent Justice, and to discharge, perform and trans<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />act all such business as may be necessary during such absence. If from any cause whatever the regular term of a Justice&#8217;s court should not be held at the time fixed by law, the business pending on the Jus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tice&#8217;s docket shall stand continued until the next regular term thereof, and all business not disposed of at a regular term of such court shall likewise stand continued until the next regular term thereof.</p>
<p>Sec. 26. Justices of the Peace shall have the same power, in cases within their jurisdiction, as Clerks of the District Court, to issue writs of attachments, sequestration and garnishment, and all laws regulating such writs in the District Court shall be held applicable to Justices&#8217; courts.</p>
<p>Sec. 27. The plaintiff in any civil suit, before process issues, or any time before final judgment, upon motion of the defendant, or any officer of the court interested in the costs accruing in such suit, may be ruled to give security for the costs; and if such rule be entered against the plaintiff, and he fail to comply therewith on or before the first day of the next term of the court, the suit shall be dismissed, unless the party ruled shall make and file an affidavit that he is unable to give such se<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />curity. All bonds given as security for costs shall have the force and effect of judgments against all the obligors for the said cost. Executors and administrators of deceased persons&#8217; estates, and guardians, shall not be ruled to give security for costs in any suit to recover money due or property belonging to the estate; and no security shall be exacted of executors or administrators of deceased persons&#8217; estates in appeals taken in suing for such money or property, or in defending suits brought against such estates for money or property. Justices of the Peace shall keep a fee book in which shall be taxed all costs accruing in any suit whether civil or criminal.</p>

<p>Sec. 32.

<p>Sec. 33. A warrant of arrest may be executed by any Sheriff or Constable in any county in this State, or other person specially author<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ized by the Justice to execute the same, wherever the defendant may be found. Every peace officer is bound to execute all process and orders directed to him from a Justice of the Peace, and if he shall fail or re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fuse to do the same, he may be fined by said Justice for contempt of court in any sum not exceeding one hundred dollars.

<p>Sec. 38. Whenever a defendant is desirous of appealing as provided in the preceding section, he shall file with the Justice a bond in double the amount of the fine and costs imposed upon him, conditioned that he shall prosecute his appeal with effect, and shall pay such fine and costs as shall be awarded against him by the County Court as well as other costs that may have been adjudged against him in the court be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />low.</p>

Second &#8212;To the payment of the annual interest of such bonds, and not less than two per cent, of the principal; and if there be any excess on hand after making the above payments for the current year, it shall be used in the purchase and cancellation of said bonds.</p>

<p>Sec. 97. If any guardian shall fail to pay any claim ordered to be paid, when demanded, upon affidavit of the demand and failure to pay being filed with the Clerk, an execution shall be issued for the amount ordered to be paid to such claimant, and costs, against the property of such guardian.</p>

<head type="main">School-houses.</head>
<p>Sec. 49. When a school community, organized on the application of parents and guardians as herein provided, has no school-house, and a majority of its members are willing to assist, with their private means or labor, in building one, and shall donate a school-site for neighbor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />hood public free school purposes, and deliver a deed therefor to the County Judge, executed to him and his successors in office in trust for public free school purposes, and shall pay for the registry of the same, they shall state the amount they propose to invest of their private means, and the value of the labor and material they propose to furnish free of charge for the erection of said house, and ask that the pro rata of the school fund to which the children in such community would be en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />titled may be set aside to assist in building said school-house. And the trustees of school communities, upon the order of the County Court, or the municipal authorities of any city or town constituting a separate school district, are hereby authorized and empowered, when deemed ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visable, to sell any property belonging to said school community to the highest bidder, for cash or on time, as they may see proper; and ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ply the proceeds to the purchase of necessary grounds, or to the build<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing, repairing or renting of school-houses.</p>
<p>Sec. 50. Upon receiving the application described in the foregoing section, the County Judge may enter an order granting said application; and notify the County Treasurer to credit such school community with the fund that may be apportioned thereto for building a school-house; provided, that the amount of money, labor, and material subscribed, to<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gether with the pro rata of the available school funds for one year to which said community would be entitled, would be sufficient to erect a comfortable school-house, with a capacity adequate to accommodate the children that may belong to said school community; provided, also, the community shall furnish one-half the amount necessary to build the house.</p>
<p>Sec. 51. Every school-house erected under the provisions of this act shall be erected under a contract for building, made with the school trustees of the school community who shall have control and direction of the work; and all accounts for labor and material furnished for said school-house shall be approved by them, and paid out of the fund ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />portioned to the school community for building purposes, on warrant of County Judge; but no such account shall be paid until the house is completed, unless the County Judge be fully satisfied, from securities deposited with the County Clerk for the use of the public school fund of the county, that the money, work, and material subscribed will be forthcoming when required in the progress of the work; provided, that nothing contained in this act shall be so construed as to prevent any school community from using the funds indicated in this section for being used in the purchase as well as the building of a school-house when the provisions of this section are complied with in reference to the title to the same.</p>
<p>Sec. 52. When the trustees of any school community not having a public school-house shall determine it to be to the interests of the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />munity they represent to rent or lease a house for school purposes in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stead of building one, they are authorized to rent or lease the same for the scholastic year; the rent so contracted to be paid by the County Treasurer out of the school fund to which the children in such com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="1045" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="209" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>munity would be entitled, upon the warrant of said trustees, approved by the County Judge; provided, the amount of rent so contracted shall not exceed six dollars per month for a suitable house, to be adjudged of by said trustees; which house so rented, for the time, shall be, as shall also each and every other community school-house, under the control of the trustees of the school community for school purposes, and for such other uses for the convenience of the neighborhood as may not interfere with school interests, but subject to the discretion of the school trustees. All school-houses erected under the provisions of this act shall be subject to the control of the trustees of the school commu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nity for whose benefit the same was erected; and, when deemed ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visable, may be disposed of as provided for in section 49 of this act.</p>

<p>Sec. 54. In no case shall any school, consisting partly of white and partly of colored children, receive any aid from the available school fund, hut the two races shall always be taught in separate public free schools.</p>
<p>Sec. 55. Any incorporated city or town in this State may have exclu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sive control of the public schools within its limits; provided, they deter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mine so to do by a majority vote of the property tax-payers of said city or town; and the Council or Board of Aldermen thereof are invested with exclusive power to maintain, regulate, control and govern all the public free schools now established or hereafter to be established within the limits of said city or town; and they are furthermore authorized to pass such ordinances, rules and regulations not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of this State, as may be necessary to establish and maintain free schools, purchase building sites, construct school-houses, and generally to promote free public education, within the limits of their respective cities or towns.</p>
<p>Sec. 56. When any such city or town shall, in good faith, elect to assume control and management of the public free schools within its limits, and shall have notified the State Board of Education, and the County Judge of the county in which it is situated, it shall receive from the Collector of Taxes in the county, on the certificate of the Board of Education, such a proportion of the public revenue in his hands as its scholastic population may entitle it to, which certificate shall be a voucher in the hands of the Collector of Taxes for so much money in his settlement with the State Comptroller. Such an additional amount as a city or town having control of public free schools may desire to raise by taxation for school purposes, shall be levied upon the taxable property in the limits of said town or city, in accordance with the usual assessment of taxes for municipal purposes; but such additional tax shall not exceed one per cent. on the city assessment of taxable property within its limits, and shall not be levied unless at an election, held for that purpose, two-thirds of those paying a tax on property in said city or incorporated town, to be determined by the last assessment rolls of said city or town, shall vote therefor. Schools thus organized and provided for by incorporated cities or towns shall be subject to the<pb n="1046" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="210" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>general laws of the State, so far as the same are applicable; but each city or town having control of schools within its limits shall constitute a separate school district, and may, by ordinance, provide for the or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ganization of schools, and the appropriation of its school fund in such manner as may be best suited to a dense school population.</p>
<p>Sec. 57.

<p>Sec. 58. The apportionment of the available public free school fund to be made by the Board of Education for the scholastic year, begin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />(n)ing September first, 1876, shall be made on the basis of the appor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tionment for the year ending August 31,1875.</p>
<p>Sec. 59. For counties organized since September 1, 1875, the Board of Education, for the first scholastic year, shall apportion the available school fund on the most reliable data, as to population, accessible.</p>
<p>Sec. 60. The annual apportionment for the support of public free schools for the scholastic year subsequent to August 31, 1876, and prior to the scholastic year which will begin after the next regular session of the Legislature, shall be based on estimates, to be furnished by the State Comptroller, of available school funds that may be received for said year.</p>
<p>Sec. 61. For the scholastic year begin(n)ing September 1, 1876, school communities may organize and apply for the benefit of the avail<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />able public free school fund at any time prior to January 1, 1877.</p>
<p>Sec. 62. County school officers, and school officers for cities and towns, under school laws in force prior to the passage of this act, shall continue to discharge the duties of their respective offices under exist<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing laws in the disbursement of school funds already appropriated, until August 31, 1876, and shall make settlement with the County Judge in their counties, who shall cause to be turned over any balance, un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />expended of school funds, to the County Treasurer, subject to the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visions of this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 63. Immediately on the passage of this act, five thousand cop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ies of the same shall be published by the Board of Education, and at once, such number as the Board may direct, shall be sent to each County Judge in the State.</p>
<p>Sec. 64. On account of the emergency resulting from the necessity of immediately promulgating this act, that the people may be advised of their rights under the same, and in time to prepare for the next schol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />astic year, this act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That in all cases where lands or real estate in this State have heretofore been subject to taxation for any year or years since the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy, but the rendition of and assessment thereof for any such year or years has been omitted, all such taxes, the rendi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion and assessment of which has been so omitted, shall be assessed upon such land and real estate, and collected in the manner hereinafter provided; provided, that all the lands in this State, and on which the taxes are unpaid, shall be assessed by the assessor of the county in which the land is situated, with all the taxes accrued thereon, in ratio to the taxation in the several counties of this State for the several years the taxes are unpaid, according to the average value of such lands in the several counties for the respective years said taxes are unpaid; and the same shall be a lien on the land until said taxes are paid, as required by this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. It shall be the duty of the Comptroller of this State, as soon as it will be possible for him to do so after the passage of this act, to make a separate list of all lands and real estate in each county for each year since the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy, which was not rendered and upon which taxes were not assessed for such year, but which was subject to taxation, by law, for such year; in preparing said lists he shall give the name of the original grantee, abstract number, number of acres and the rate of State and county taxes for such year, and shall forward the same to the Board of Equalization of the respec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tive counties, with the verification that the said list is a true and correct statement of all the unrendered land and real estate in ----- county for the year -----, as shown by the records of his office.</p>
<p>Sec. 3.

<p>Sec. 5. Upon receipt of the rolls by the Collector of Taxes, he shall advertise in some weekly newspaper published in his county, and if no paper is published in his county by posting printed circulars in not less eight public places in his county, for four consecutive weeks, that the rolls for the collection of taxes on unrendered land and real estate has been placed in his hands, and that unless the taxes are paid within thirty days after the last publication of said notice, he will proceed to collect the same as provided by law for the collection of delinquent taxes.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. The Collector of Taxes shall, at the expiration of the thirty days mentioned in Section 5 of this act, proceed to the collection of all unpaid taxes or unrendered land and real estate in his county in the same manner as provided by law for the collection of delinquent taxes, and shall charge and collect such fees and penalties the same as are allowed him for the collection of said delinquent taxes; provided, that the owner of such unrendered land and real estate, or his agent, shall, upon the payment of all taxes due upon the same since the first day of January A.

<p>Sec. 8. It is the duty of the Commissioner: First&#8212;To see that all laws of this State respecting insurance companies are faithfully executed. Second&#8212;To file in his office every charter or declaration of organization of a company, with the certificate of the Attorney-General, and on appli<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cation of the corporators, to furnish them with a certified copy thereof.

Fourth&#8212;Calculations of the net value of each policy shall be based upon the American experience table of mortality, and four and one<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />half per cent. interest per annum. And the net value of a policy at any time shall be taken to be the net single premium which will at that time effect the insurance, less the value at that time of the future net premiums called for by the table of mortality and rate of interest des<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ignated above. Fifth&#8212;In case it is found that any life insurance com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pany doing business in this State has not on hand the net value of all its policies in force, after all other debts of the company, and claims against it, exclusive of capital stock, have been provided for, it shall be the duty of the Insurance Commissioner to publish the fact that the then existing condition of the affairs of the company is below the standard of legal safety established by this State, and he shall require the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pany at once to cease doing new business, and he shall immediately in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stitute proceedings, as required in this act, to determine what further shall be done in the case.

Seventh&#8212;He shall<pb n="1057" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="221" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>accept the valuation made by the Insurance Commissioner of the State under whose authority a life insurance company was organized, when such valuations have been properly made on sound and recognized principles, and legal basis as above; provided, the company shall furnish to the Insurance Commissioner of this State a certificate of the Insurance Commissioner of such State, setting forth the value calculated on the data designated above, of all the policies in force in the company on the previous thirty-first day of December, and stating that, after all other debts of the company, and claims against it at that time, were provided for, the company had, in safe securities of the character speci<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fied in this act, an amount equal to the net value of all its policies in force, and that said company is entitled to do business in its own State. Eighth&#8212;Every life insurance company doing business in this State dur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing the year for which the statement is made, that fails promptly to furnish the certificate aforesaid, shall be required to make full detailed lists of policies and securities to the Insurance Commissioner of this State, and shall be liable for all charges and expenses consequent upon not having furnished said certificate. Ninth&#8212;Eor every company doing fire insurance business in this State, he shall calculate the re-insurance reserve for unexpired fire risks, by taking fifty per cent. of the premiums received on all unexpired risks that have less than one year to run, and a pro rata of all premiums received on risks that have more than one year to run; provided, that when the re-insurance reserve, calcu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lated as above, is less than forty per cent. of all the premiums re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceived during the year, the re-insurance reserve in this case shall be the whole of the premiums received on all of its unexpired risks. Tenth&#8212;In marine and inland insurance he shall charge all the premi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ums received on unexpired risks as a re-insurance reserve. Eleventh&#8212; Having charged against a company the re-insurance reserve, as above determined, for fire, inland and marine insurance, and adding thereto all other debts and claims against the company, he shall, in case he find the capital stock of the company impaired to the extent of twenty per cent., give notice to the company to make good its whole capital stock within sixty days; and if this is not done, he shall require the company to cease to do business within this State, and shall thereupon, in case the company is organized under authority of the State, imme<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />diately institute legal proceedings, as required in this act, to determine what further shall be done in the case. Any company having received the aforesaid notice of the Commissioner to make good its whole cap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ital stock within sixty days, shall, forthwith, call upon its stockholders for such amounts as will make its capital equal to the amount fixed by the charter of said company; and, in case any stockholder of such company shall neglect or refuse to pay the amount so called for, after notice personally given or by advertisement in such time and manner as the said Commissioner shall approve, it shall be lawful for said com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pany to require the return of the original certificate of stock held by such stockholder, and in lieu thereof to issue new certificates for such number of shares as the said stockholders may be entitled to in the proportion that the ascertained value of the funds of said company may<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />be found to bear to the original capital of said company; the value of such shares, for which new certificates shall be issued, to be ascer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tained under the direction of said Commissioner and the company pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing for the fractional parts of shares; and it shall be lawful for the Di<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rectors of such company to create new stock and dispose of the same,<pb n="1058" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="222" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>and to issue new certificates therefor, to any amount sufficient to make up the original capital of the company. Whenever the capital stock of any joint stock, fire, fire and marine, or marine insurance company of the State becomes impaired, the Commissioner may, in his discretion, permit the said company to reduce its capital stock and the par value of its shares in proportion to the extent of impairment; provided, that in fixing such reduced capital, no sum exceeding twenty-five thousand dollars shall be deducted from the assets and property on hand, which shall be retained as surplus assets; and, provided, that no part of such assets and property shall be distributed to the stockholders; and, pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided further, that the capital stock shall not be reduced to an amount less than that required by law for the organization of a new company; to examine, or cause to be examined every detail of the business of any company, transacting business of insurance within this State, whenever in his judgment such examination is required by the interest of the policy-holders of such company. Twelfth&#8212;It shall be the duty of the Commissioner of Insurance, after he has notified a life insurance com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pany organized under authority of this State, to cease doing new business until the net value of its policies in force is equal to that called for by the standard of safety established by the State, at once to cause a rigid examination in regard to the affairs of such company; in case it shall appear that there is no fraud or gross incompetency or recklessness shown to exist in the management, he may, upon publishing the facts in the case, permit such company to continue in charge of its business for one year; provided, there is in his opinion, reason to believe that the company may eventually be able to re-establish the legal net value of its policies in force. At the end of the year named above, he may renew the permission in case on examination he is satisfied that the company is likely to retrieve its affairs. Thirteenth&#8212;In case the Commissioner does not permit the company to continue in the control of its old busi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ness, it is hereby made his duty to institute the necessary proceedings for the protection of its policy-holders in accordance with the laws of this State. Fourteenth&#8212;To publish the result of his examination of the affairs of any company whenever he deems it for the interest of the public to do so, in one or more papers of this State. Fifteenth&#8212;To sus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pend the entire business of any company of this State, and the business within this State of any other company during its non-compliance with any provisions of this or any other act relative to insurance, or when<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ever its assets appear to him insufficient to justify its continuance in business, by suspending or revoking the certificate granted by him, and to give notice thereof to the Insurance Commissioner or other similar officer of every State, and publish the same in such paper as he may think proper. Sixteenth&#8212;To institute or cause to be instituted the nec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />`essary proceedings under the laws of this State, to close the affairs of any insurance company of this State which shall appear to him upon examination to be insolvent or fraudulently conducted. Seventeenth&#8212; To report in detail to the Attorney-General, any violation of law relative to insurance companies, their officers or agents, or the business of in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />surance. Eighteenth&#8212;To furnish to the companies required by law to report to him, the necessary blank forms for the statements required. Nineteenth&#8212;To preserve in a permanent form a full record of his pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceedings, and a concise statement of the condition of each company or agency visited or examined. Twentieth&#8212;At the request of any person, and on payment of fee, to give certified copies of any record or papers<pb n="1059" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="223" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>in his office, when he deems it not prejudicial to public interest so to do, and to give such other certificates as the law provides for. Twenty-first &#8212;To report annually to the Governor, on or before the thirty-first day of December, the name and compensation of his clerks, the receipts and expenses of his department for the year, his official acts, the condition of companies doing business in this State, and such other information as will exhibit the affairs of said department. Twenty-second&#8212;To send a copy of his annual report to the Insurance Commissioner or any similar officer of every other State, and to each company doing business in this State. Twenty-third&#8212;On request, to communicate with the Insurance Commissioner of any other State in which the substantial provisions of this act shall be enacted, any facts which by law it is his duty to ascertain, respecting companies of this State doing business within such other State. Twenty-fourth&#8212;It shall be his duty to see that no company is permitted to insure lives in this State whose charter authorizes it to do a fire, marine or inland business.</p>

<p>Sec. 3. That the Presiding Judges of the District Courts of the sev<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral Judicial Districts shall, at the first regular term of their courts after this act shall become a law, or as soon thereafter as practicable, severally appoint a Board of Medical Examiners, for their respective districts, to be composed of not less than three practicing physicians of known abil<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ity, and having certificates of qualification for the practice of medicine under the &#8220;Act to regulate the practice of medicine,&#8221; passed May 16, 1873, said Board of Examiners to continue in office two years from and after their appointment; and they shall, immediately after accept<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing such appointment, select one of their number President, and one as Secretary, and adopt all necessary rules for the guidance and control of their meetings. It shall be the duty of said Board of Medical Examiners to examine all applicants for certificates of qualification to practice med<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cine, in any of its branches or departments, in this State, whether such applicants are furnished with medical diplomas or not, upon the following named subjects, to-wit: Anatomy, physiology, pathological anatomy and pathology, surgery, obstetrics, and chemistry; said examination to be thorough.

Each and every one of such Boards shall procure a seal, as soon as practicable after their organization, which seal shall be impressed upon every certificate granted.</p>
<p>Sec. 5.

</opener>
<p>Whereas, Public policy and private economy encourage the inclosing of lands of separate owners in one inclosure for pasturage, therefore,</p>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That whenever lands of separate owners shall be in one inclosure for pasturage, exclusive of any interior inclosure, either with or without an agreement among any or all of such separate owners in relation to com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mon pasturage of their respective portions of such pastoral premises, the District Court for any county in which all or part of such premises may be situated shall have jurisdiction to determine and enforce the pastoral rights of such owners, according to appropriate equity.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. In case of an agreement among any or all of such separate owners in relation to common pasturage of their respective portions of suck pastoral premises, any interested party may proceed in court, in the usual way, for redress on account of alleged injury, either enforce the agreement, or to rescind it with other relief; and in the latter alternative, to procure equitable adjustment, including provision for the subsequent use of the premises.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. When the interests in such pasturage shall not be affected by contract, any interested party may proceed in court, in the usual<pb n="1070" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="234" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>way to have the rights of pasturage apportioned among such separate owners; and the proportions of common pasturage shall be equitable, with due appreciation not only of the values of the pasturages of the land so owned respectively, but also of the comparative values of cor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />responding portions of the inclosing work, and also of the actual values of contributions to such work in behalf of the separate interests in such pasturage. In making such apportionment, the court if it should con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sider such aid necessary, would be authorized to have such values esti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mated by commissioners, to be appointed by the court, and sworn to perform their duties as prescribed in an order of the court. The com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners might have assistance by a surveyor, if the order should so provide; and the costs of such commission, for allowance and payment, would be as provided by order of the court. Any report of the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners would be subject to approval or rejection by the court. When approved, such report would be competent evidence in the trial of the case, without being conclusive, to be used in connection with other evi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dence.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. This act applies to separate ownerships of land, as inclosed by any means that may be sufficient to prevent ordinary passing of the larger kinds of live stock, whether such hinderance be artificial or nat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ural, in whole or in part, including a water boundary. And this act rec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ognizes the right of any owner of land to inclose it, not intruding on the premises of a separate owner, although his land be also inclosed, by using either artificial or natural means, or both kinds, adapted to prevent ordinary passing of such live stock, and so availing, when prac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ticable, of the common right of a proprietor of land to use an adjacent water boundary for the purpose of inclosure.</p>
